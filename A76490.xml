            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT I take the Boldneſs to make this <hi>Dedication</hi> to your Lordſhip, is not, that I can make the leaſt pretenſion to be Known to, or to Know your Lordſhip; but as you are on ſuch an Eminence, you cannot be hid; and as a <hi>Luminary</hi> of the Nation, every Eye is upon you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:135384:4"/>
            <p> But yet I have made this Preſumption on Great Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That, the Truths I offer in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe, are ſo little conſider'd, or Receiv'd; that they are under a Neceſſity to remove from the Rigor of Prejudicate Opinion, and to make Appeal to the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> of a moſt Equitable <hi>Review.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, that I have much Reaſon to be perſwaded, your Lordſhip hath in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, in the Greatneſs of your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, the Noble Freedoms of a ſolid Judgment, and moſt condeſcending <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Temper,</hi> a truly <hi>High Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> in your own Breaſt; and will allow it to ſober Propoſals of Truth, <hi>Analogous</hi> to Faith, and Chriſtian Morality, however Old <hi>Bottles,</hi> and <hi>Palates</hi> refuſe <hi>New Wine;</hi> New to them, not ſo in it ſelf; but ſpoken of by <hi>All the Prophets ſince the World began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Great Reaſon I have, is, That tho I pretend to no Prognoſticks, except Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb facs="tcp:135384:4"/> by the <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy;</hi> yet, ſpeaking humanely, it is very probable your Lordſhip ſhall continue in your High Adminiſtration till 97. and then I have Great Aſſurance, it will be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made much Higher, and more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, by the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of that Great <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth</hi> coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Succeſſion: Wherein, undoubtedly, every <hi>Character of Humane Honour;</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and Juſtified by his Word, and ſeated in Perſons ready <hi>to Kiſs the Son,</hi> and pay Homage to him; will receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Additions.</p>
            <p>And hereunto <hi>I</hi> add, That it is moſt Reaſonable, ſo publick a <hi>Perſonage,</hi> and that bears, as is ſaid, the <hi>Conſcience of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and ſo fitteſt to make Judgment on ſuch a Point; ſhould have both the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> of ſo great a Thing laid before him, and before the whole Nation in him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:135384:5"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Although I very well know how Great a Prince I herein ſerve, and do moſt Freely, ſubmit, as to my ſelf, to his turning your Heart this way, or that way, as the <hi>Rivers of Water;</hi> yet I think it no way diſagreeing to my Duty, according to his preſent Diſpoſe, to deſire ſuch a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage as that of your <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> that <hi>I</hi> might reſt under your ſhadow; and wait for the mighty Ratifications of All I have writ on ſo great a Subject; by Mighty Power.</p>
            <p>It is now <hi>(My Lord)</hi> Ten Years, ſince I firſt made Publick the <hi>Prophetick Calendar of Time;</hi> and I have not found Reaſon to Vary from the Firſt <hi>Moments,</hi> on which <hi>I</hi> Fix'd it; but have receiv'd Greater Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Light, and Aſſurance, as I have continually, and publickly Remonſtrated; and yet I have always, and do ftill diſown all things <hi>Enthuſiaſtick,</hi> and am upon the plain Principles of Letter of Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:135384:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> Scripture Arguments, according to the moſt undoubted <hi>Chronology,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and ſo offer my ſelf Freely to the Attack of All that can bring Contrary Reaſons: And have now, as in a <hi>Chancery Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> preſented the Caſe to your <hi>Lordſhip;</hi> Let him that finds Reaſon, in the ſame Way, put in his <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Greater Cauſe, than this cannot come before <hi>your Lordſhip;</hi> Whether the <hi>Books of the Prophets of the New and Old Teſtament</hi> have declar'd ſuch a Glorious, Viſible <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt;</hi> Whether they have declar'd it ſhall be Firſt in Succeſſion, preparing for its Glory by an Univerſal Preaching of the Goſpel, as by a <hi>Flying Angel,</hi> ſeal'd with the Return of Miracles; For All this I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; And whether they have given a <hi>Line of Time,</hi> Determining that Succeſſion to 1697.

               <pb facs="tcp:135384:8"/> 
               <hi>concerning the</hi> Paſſover; <hi>I would not ſet my ſelf to Write</hi> (I do not ſay, declare) <hi>any more concerning it; Except Any one ſhould call Publickly, and in Print, for an Anſwer of Any</hi> Objection <hi>made to it till it be</hi> Fullfill'd in the Succeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I Know many will be very Forward to blame me, <hi>in this</hi> Confidence (as I know it will ſeem alſo) <hi>of</hi> Boaſting. <hi>But I have well weigh'd my</hi> Grounds, <hi>and do</hi> not Fear. <hi>I</hi> know whom, <hi>and</hi> what I have Believed upon; <hi>and Reſt Secure</hi> He will bring it to paſs and Haſten it in its own Time, I have declared</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>According to the</hi> very Infirmity of the Preſent State, I have ballanc'd the matter; <hi>I know if</hi> Things, <hi>which can neither</hi> Deceive, <hi>nor be</hi> Deceived, <hi>Ratifie what I have written, God hath not vouchſafed by Any, to Declare Them, ſo Publickly Appearing, as he hath</hi> by one moſt Unworthy, <hi>and Deſirous to Lye in the</hi> Duſt before him, <hi>and All his People, in the Sence of</hi> my own Unworthineſs; <hi>If ſo; Whatever hath, or ſhall befall me,</hi> None <hi>ſhall</hi> take This Glory from me, <hi>nor from the</hi> Remembrance of me: <hi>That I have beon thus Enabled by Him,</hi> to Speak,
<pb facs="tcp:135384:8"/> 
               <hi>and</hi> Write thus, <hi>concerning the</hi> Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt, and the</hi> Time of its Succeſſion; I Remember yet with due Honor <hi>that</hi> Fellow-Helper <hi>in his</hi> Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <hi>on the</hi> Revelation; <hi>Yet the leaſt</hi> in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of that Kingdom, <hi>ſhall be much greater,</hi> than Any can be now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, if</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>I may have been Deceiv'd</hi> on ſuch Grounds, <hi>as</hi> I Reſt upon; I <hi>ſhould</hi> neither Expect, nor Deſire to have the mercy; <hi>ſo Great</hi> a Confidence ſhould be <hi>covered</hi> in Silence; <hi>But that my</hi> ſo Great Aſſurance <hi>ſhould he ſet as</hi> a Sea-mark, <hi>to</hi> Caution All Others, <hi>and to reſt as</hi> an unremovable Shame, <hi>and</hi> Confuſion on my ſelf and Name.</p>

               <p> For This <hi>Great Salvation</hi> hath a double Evidence and Aſſurance of its Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>It began to be spoken by the Lord, who ſo spake, that if he had not come and spoken to Them, They had had no ſin;</hi> For He <hi>was mighty in Word</hi> as well as <hi>Deed; He ſpoke as never man ſpake;</hi> and <hi>It was confirmed by them that Heard Him,</hi> even by <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> who went forth in the ſame Spirit, and Power of Truth.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Theſe <hi>Divers Miracles, Signs and Wonders,</hi> were ſubject to the Wiſe, and Holy Couſel of the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit.</hi> So that only <hi>where, when, on whom, and by whom</hi> This Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Power ſhould be diſpens'd, was, as on many Accounts is after to be obſerv'd; wholly after <hi>the Counſel of his own Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle gives the Reaſon of theſe Miraculous Powers being thus diſpens'd by his own Immediate, Increated Will and Pleaſure; Becauſe they Cloſely Appertain to, and are Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>the World to come, whereof</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we ſpeak;</hi> That is, do now, and ought to ſpeak continually, and only, as of that World ſo incomparably Great, that God will neither truſt Holy Angels to have any Adminiſtration of, but as Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Apoſtles were at any time by a Power given immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to them; and not the Power Reſident in, and Connatural to their own Beings, under the General Divine Concourſe, and Command or Permiſſion; For Miraculous Power, truly ſo, God never can Give out of his own Hand; much leſs therefore will he permit Bad Angels to uſe it; and when this World ſhall appear in Glory, they ſhall be <hi>ſealed up in their own Abyſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That therefore which I propoſe, by the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God, to diſcourſe on ſo great a Point, ſhall conſiſt of ſeveral Heads, whereby our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Underſtandings may be Enlightned,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135384:12"/> and our Hearts Affected with many Truths of Exceeding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would cloſely enquire into, and endeavour to Explain the Nature of <hi>Miracles in general,</hi> and what place there is for any ſuch Appearances of God; even peculiarly, and as on purpoſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or left for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would ſearch after the Great Ends and Reaſons why God hath at any Time Appear'd by Miraculous Powers in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall endeavour to make out, That though there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed other Great Reaſons and Ends of Miracles, yet there is none ſo Supream and Soveraign, as that they are deſign'd by God to be not only <hi>Pawns and Pledges,</hi> but <hi>Pieces,</hi> and <hi>Portions,</hi> or <hi>Parcels</hi> of that <hi>World to come.</hi> And that this will be found to be the moſt Adequate Reaſon, or End of Miracles, upon True and Impartial Enquiry, and ſeparation from prejudice, and pre-poſſeſſion of other more Received Opinions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall conſider what Times we read of in Scripture, which God hath been pleas'd moſt of all to illuſtrate, and make Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, by Miracles; and what Times have been a <hi>Dark Place,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, (on occaſion moſt agreeable herewith, if not abſolutely the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of <hi>the powers of the World to come,</hi> not appearing in it;) and on what Accounts, upon a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of one with the other, there have been ſuch Differences, and ſo great a Non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Appearance of Miracles theſe Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty Years.</p>

                  </gap>ſe Attendance of Thought given to Creation and Providence; that it may be known wherein they and Miracles differ one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For if we do not look upon Miracles in that, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Rightly and Diſtinctly comprehended: For it is Evident, <hi>Miracles, Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> are ſome <hi>Appearances of God,</hi> that ſeem to us to Tranſcend, and to be Exalted above the State of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſtate of Providence, and of the Government of the World at this day.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if things were rightly ſtated; there is no other difference between Miracle and Creation, but that Creation we look upon, as a thing paſt and done, ſettled and fix'd Ages ago; but Miracle is a thing New, and Freſh, as we may ſay, out of the Mint of Divine Power; and ſo Providence, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World we are Acquainted and Familiar with, as things that in ſome Points of them we ſee every Day; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we find, that in the continual Toſſing and Rolling of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135384:13"/> Things, they are now and then thrown and caſt up, and at leaſt in a Revolution and larger ſpaces of Time, do at one time or other ſhew Themſelves; and whether they every day, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are ſeen, we can give Account of them, or make proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conjectures how they come to paſs by the Train, Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Dependance of one thing upon another; and ſo they are accounted no Miracles; but ſtill they are in themſelves all of the Nature of Miracles.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is no Miracle to us now, that there is a Sun gives Light by Day, and the Moon by Night; this is no Miracle, as we account it now: But I deſire you to conſider, if there had been any men, as it is generally allowed, there were Angels at the very beginning of the Creation, when the <hi>Earth was without Form,</hi> and <hi>Void,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs was upon the Face of the Deep;</hi> What a Miracle had it been in our Senſe, to ſee Light? When <hi>God ſaid, let there be Light. and there was Light;</hi> And ſo if any had been in any Former Day, and ſeen the making the Things that were not made out of <hi>Things</hi> that did appear before, until every fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Day; as the wonderful diſpoſal of the Waters, of the Light, as diffuſed into the Lights of Heaven; the Creatures Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Earth. All theſe, if any Intelligent Being were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as the Angels, thoſe <hi>Morning-Stars</hi> ſhouting for Joy, muſt not he needs have acknowledg'd all Miracle?</p>
               <p>And ſo in the Government of Providence, if we were wiſe to obſerve it throughout, every day we ſhould ſee miracles: Onely this it is becauſe the order is ſtated, ſettled, conſtituted ſo long ago; Therefore men have got another word for Creation, and Providence; that is; <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>courſe of nature;</hi> Becauſe they conſider, they are ſettled; but do not conſider, not onely whoſe ordinance firſt ſettled them, but that every moment the <hi>word going out of the mouth</hi> of <hi>God</hi> continues them, becauſe <hi>all are Gods ſervants,</hi> and they need a Freſh command every minute. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work, without any Sabbath,</hi> Jo. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Oh how admirably is God himſelf pleaſed to diſcourſe this matter, and that very largely too in the latter end of the book of <hi>Job;</hi> As to creation, <hi>Job.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 2. &amp;c. Saith God to <hi>Job; Gird up thy Loins now like a man; For I will Demand of thee, and anſwer thou me; Where waſt thou, when I laid the Foundations of the earth? Declare now, if thou haſt underſtanding;</hi> who hath <hi>layd the meaſures of it, if thou knoweſt? Or who hath stretched the Line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof Faſten'd? Or who layd the Corner ſtone thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Morning ſtars ſang together, and the ſons of God ſhouted fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:135384:14"/> 
                  <hi>Joy;</hi> or who ſhut up the <hi>Sea with Doors when it brake forth, as if it had Iſſued out of the womb?</hi> And ſo he goes on through the whole creation.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, if God ſhould come to the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of our days, to the men that are <hi>ſetting their mouth againſt the Heaven,</hi> and their <hi>Tongue walking through the Earth,</hi> if God ſhould come, and ſay to them; Come now you Mighty Men of Wit, and Reaſon, and Senſe, that look upon all as ſillyneſs, but that you your ſelves ſpeak; what if you had been by, when I was <hi>Laying the Foundations of the Earth,</hi> and had heard me command Light? when the <hi>Earth was without Form,</hi> and <hi>Void,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> was upon the <hi>Face of it,</hi> and it immediately appear'd? would you have allowed it a Miracle or not? Would you have diſputed it with the Heavenly Hoſt, <hi>ſinging,</hi> and <hi>ſhouting too for joy at it?</hi> Conſider it every way, and then give me an Anſwer, is it Miracle or not?</p>
               <p>And, as it is thus concerning Creation, ſo concerning Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; it is perfect Miracle; for what is Miracle, but an Effect riſing from the immediate word of God; now how does our Meat preſerve our Life? not by it ſelf only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God, as our Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us.</p>
               <p>So, How do our <hi>Cloaths warm us?</hi> How does the whole Courſe of Nature maintain its Circulation? We are as ignorant in all theſe things, even as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, when Chriſt either Heal'd the Sick, or the Lame, or open'd the Eyes of the Blind, or caſt out Devils, or whatever were the great things he did, and yet ſtill, the things were <hi>evident Matters of Fact:</hi> Even ſo it is in the <hi>Dayly Evidences</hi> of the Divine Power, and Greatneſs, and Goodneſs in the Creation, and Dayly Providence.</p>
               <p>How excellently does <hi>David</hi> ſpeak upon this <hi>Subject, Pſalm</hi> 104. He goes through this whole <hi>Oeconomy of Creation,</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and therefore he begins thus, <hi>Oh Lord my God, thou art very Great; Thou art Cloathed with Honour und Majeſty, who covereſt thy ſelf with Light, as with a Garment,</hi> and ſo on. Now if we do really believe, that the whole World ſtands by <hi>Immediate Divine Power,</hi> and that every day the Motions of it <hi>come freſh out of the Hand of God,</hi> and that beyond all <hi>Natural Cauſes</hi> or <hi>Connexion</hi> of <hi>Cauſes;</hi> then we muſt acknowledg Miracles every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Prophet Jeremy</hi> tells us, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>It is of the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we are not Conſumed, and becauſe his compaſſions fail not, they are new every Morning.</hi> We are ready to think the Light and the Life, and the mercy of this Day, are the ſame they were Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135384:14"/> but if we believe the Spirit of God by that Prophet, they are not the ſame, though of the ſame for Kind; yet not the ſame by any neceſſary Continuation, or Natural Connexion with thoſe of Yeſterday; but new, <hi>new every Morning:</hi> Now if the mercy of this <hi>Morning be new,</hi> why then it is certainly a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; becauſe no Power of a Creature could have produced it, or brought it forth, but an <hi>Immediate Act of the Power of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God;</hi> And he had not done it ſo yeſterday, that he muſt needs do it to day; yet if he did not generally do it, and that anew, our Life muſt ceaſe for ever; Oh if our Hearts did but Live under this <hi>Senſe of God,</hi> how <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Dependent</hi> would it make us! We are ready to think it is the Suns Duty to Riſe to Day, becauſe it Roſe Yeſterday, and we are too ready to Build upon it, that our Life ſhall be to Day, as it was Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but if we could conſider, that it is indeed a <hi>New Life every Day, yea, every Moment,</hi> and that whatever Channel it runs through, yet that God alone is the Giver immediately from Himſelf; and it is continually a <hi>New Gift.</hi> If a Man were Dead, and Raiſed again from the Dead, then every one would look about them, and make a great wonder; but if we went up to the Fountain Head, we ſhould find the very ſame Power, that Raiſes the Dead, giving Life every Moment; and if we could ſee but into that, we ſhould ſee Miracle in the one, even as in the other: for both are immediately from <hi>Infinite Power;</hi> Both are New; Only one is out of the Ordinary Courſe of Gods Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, the other not ſo.</p>
               <p>I would only argue this further on one place of Scripture, and ſo paſs on. It is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The Inviſible Things of him, from the Creation of the World, are clearly understood by the Things that are made. Even his Eternal Power and Godhead; ſo that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excuſe.</hi> The Apoſtle affirms, <hi>The Eternal Power and Godhead are in themſelves clearly to be ſeen round about us, by the Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence,</hi> and ſo as to <hi>leave without Excuſe.</hi> Although therefore we ſee not thus clearly, even the beſt of us; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bruitiſh, Atheiſtick Men not at all; yet this cannot make the Apoſtle's Words of no Effect; They continue Firm; <hi>The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Godhead are ſo to be ſeen, as to leave men without Excuſe.</hi> What now can Miracles do more? They can only alarm, or call us to cloſer Attendance: They cannot more clearly inform, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten or aſſure. We may therefore juſtly ſay of Creation and Providence, compar'd with Miracles, as the Lord ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> compar'd with <hi>one riſing from the Dead:</hi> If they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135384:15"/> will not <hi>believe the one,</hi> they will not be <hi>perſwaded by the other:</hi> If not by Creation and Providence, no not by Miracles:</p>
               <p>I would therefore conſider what is ſaid by the Men of Wit and Reaſon, as they are ready to Eſteem themſelves: They would ſuppoſe, that Matter and Motion being either Eternal, as ſome would have it, or Created by God, as others would at leaſt ſeem to allow; and then either by themſelves, or by a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Supreme Being, they could together, according to a ſort of Mechanick Law, do every thing. But we ſee how ſoon, not only the Works of Art, but even of Nature, Run out of Order, or wear out themſelves. It is True, if all things could have produced themſelves, there were an End of the Miracle of Creation; Or if when made, they could Govern themſelves, There were then indeed no Miracle of Providence, but what tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nature wholly out of its Courſe.</p>
               <p>But to us inſtructed by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the whole Frame of Creation is like a well Tuned Inſtrument, every String wound up to its due Tenor; but in evèry ſingle String, and the whole Harmony, the Divine Hand was immediately, even wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Second Cauſe had the leaſt Activity: Every Wheel in this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Machine was plac'd by his Finger; And when all was put together, and ſo Tun'd, All had for ever notwithſtanding lain ſtill, like an Inſtrument on which the Muſicians Hand never came, or was removed; Or as a Clock or Watch, whoſe Weights or Spring were never wound up, or quite down, or taken off. And to this Frame, and this Motion, no Vicarious Hand, but the Creator's alone, can ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce. He is every moment even a-new the Fountain of Life, Being and Motion; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In him we live, move, and have our Being.</hi> So that Creation and Providence are ſtill Miracles. The <hi>Sun</hi> (and ſo all other of the Works of Creation, in their proportion) <hi>is prepared,</hi> as <hi>a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh that therefore <hi>our ſouls</hi> could <hi>Bleſs the Lord, while we have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>all that is within us praiſe his Holy Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the meditation of Him, and his Works, could be ſweet to us,</hi> and that we could ſay, <hi>we need not Miracles</hi> as further Evidences of his Creating Power, or Preſerving Goodneſs, but for the Diſplays thereof to other High Ends, to be hereafter aſſign'd. For I have been thus large in this matter, it being both ſo Noble a Point, as alſo becauſe it makes much to the True Conſideration of the Chief End of Miracles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But as Things are now, That All Things do not unite in a State of Wrath and Ruine, is becauſe the <hi>Mediator purging our ſins, upholds All with the Word of his Power.</hi> Elſe, as God ſaid, when Wickedneſs had broken into the World, to ſo great an heighth, <hi>I, even I, do bring a Flood upon the World;</hi> So he had put an End to it at the firſt coming in of ſin, had not the Mediator come between, in the <hi>Seed of the Woman breaking the Serpents Head.</hi> But when <hi>Noah</hi> had <hi>offered a Sacrifice,</hi> an undoubted Type of the Sacrifice of Chriſt; God then promis'd he would <hi>not Curſe the Ground ſo, any more,</hi> but there ſhould be <hi>Summer and Winter, Spring and Harveſt, Day and Night,</hi> until the very coming in of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of All Things.

But yet ſtill there are ſuch legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Curſe, in innumerable Kinds, that they give full place to Miracles, in further and higher Grace, to relieve againſt that Curſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There being ſuch a State of Mercy and Grace, through the Mediator, there is place alſo given to another ſort of Miracles, <hi>viz.</hi> Miracles of Greater and more Extraordinary <hi>Strokes of Wrath</hi> than generally we obſerve in the World; wherein the Mediator ſo far deſerts his Interpoſal of Mediation, and then Miracle of Judgment immediately enters ſo far alſo; as may appear in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Great Inſtances to be given: And this I deſire you would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135384:16"/> attend to; becauſe it will be found to contribute very much to the clearing the Great Point of Miracles: I begin therefore the clearing this Matter in that firſt Judgment of the <hi>Flood upon the Old World.</hi> In which, as alſo in the Judgment on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> inſtance; becauſe, as is after to be ſhewn, they have Great Concernment in making it appear, That Miracles appertain <hi>to the world to come,</hi> whereof we are ſpeaking.</p>

               <p> In the ſame manner the <hi>Plagues of Aegypt</hi> were <hi>Miracles of Judgment;</hi> becauſe the Mediator was coming, (in <hi>Exodus</hi> all along to <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.) up againſt them with a Glorious Type of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Spiritual Aegypt,</hi> with his <hi>Seven Vials, Revel.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 16. made on purpoſe parallel to the <hi>Plagues of Aegypt.</hi> Now the Reaſon was, the Mediator in Grace no longer undertook for <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but <hi>ſet</hi> him up as a <hi>Rock</hi> for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be planted againſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt Miracle of Judgment I will inſtance in, becauſe it much declares the Nature of Miracle, is that of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> Numb. 16. 29. <hi>If theſe men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, dye the common Death of all men,</hi> or if <hi>they be viſited after the common Viſitation of all men, Then the Lord hath not ſent me.</hi> But if <hi>the Lord create a New Thing, and the Earth open her mouth, and ſwallow them up, with all that appertains to them, and they go down quick into the pit: Then ye ſhall underſtand, theſe men have provoked the Lord.</hi> Every Miracle, as hath been ſpoken, is a <hi>New Thing;</hi> This is the Nature of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, whether it be a Miracle of Mercy or of Judgment; A <hi>New Thing</hi> of Mercy lifting up the preſent State ſettled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, by the <hi>Grace of the Mediator;</hi> or a <hi>New Thing</hi> in Judgment, when the Mediator deſerts this State upheld by him, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment breaks in above Ordinary Judgments; and this to ſhew that Deſolation, that ſhall be at laſt upon this World of the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> that the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and the <hi>New Earth, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> may come in. Thus this <hi>Opening</hi> and <hi>Swallowng Alive,</hi> is like the <hi>Opening of the Lake,</hi> into which the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> thoſe Apoſtate Pretenders to be <hi>Sons of Levi,</hi> are <hi>caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> Rev. 19. as the whole <hi>Antichriſtian Race</hi> ſay, <hi>They are Jews, but are not, but do lye,</hi> and ſo are given up to Wrath by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
               <p>Thus it will be at the laſt <hi>Burning of the Earth, and of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it;</hi> Then the Mediator will bear up the <hi>World no longer.</hi> Thus when any particular Perſon is deſtroy'd, cut off by Death, and caſt into Hell, until that very Time the Mediator undertakes; Then he undertakes no longer for him.</p>

We find the preſent State in an <hi>Equipoize,</hi> in an Even Ballance between the Grace of, and by the <hi>Mediator,</hi> and the Wrath and Juſtice of God keeping its Hold upon this World of <hi>Apoſlate Adam;</hi> And both the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Things by Grace and Mercy, and yet under Wrath and Juſtice, are now Call'd, and Styl'd, and Deem'd to be <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>

                  <hi>the State of Nature, the Law of Nature, the Courſe of Nature</hi> And whatever there is either in Mercy or Judgment, wherein a Divine Hand, a High Hand, a Hand Lifted up, and made Bare, appears, is called and ſtyled <hi>Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Light and Glory of the Heaven, the Fruitfulneſs of the Earth, the ſo General Health, Beauty, and Vigour of Body; the Order, Peace and Good Government we at any time obſerve in the World, we look not upon as Miracle, but as the Natural State of Things, under the General Goodneſs of God; though indeed, as hath been ſhewn, it is the Goodneſs of God in the Mediator; But together with theſe, we allow Storms, Tempeſts, Unfruitful Seaſons, Peſtilence, Famine, Sickneſs, Lameneſs, Poverty, Want. Deformity, Death, agreeable to the Courſe of Nature alſo, and no Miracle; Yet indeed why are They not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous? when God made the World in ſuch an Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if we'll call it Nature. Can we think when God made Man in that Noble State of his <hi>own Image,</hi> it can be any other than Miracle of Judgment? Men are left to be ſuch Butchers one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that it is counted <hi>a Glory, a Bed of Honour to dye ſo doing:</hi> No, undoubtedly, Even that Chriſt ſhall Reſtore the World to, as the <hi>Prince of Peace, to learn War no more,</hi> and to make the <hi>Battle ceaſe to the Ends of the Earth,</hi> is that which was at firſt the State of unfallen Nature. And all the contrary State is Miracle of Judgment; however, becauſe ſetled, we do not call it ſo: When Navies and Fleets are deſtroyed at Sea, and Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and deſolated, and all the Sinews of Government loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; we do not call this Miracle: And yet from the <hi>Beginning theſe Things were not ſo,</hi> nor deſign'd to be ſo much as Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Natural; but becauſe, according to the Wiſdom, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Juſtice of God, the Mediator upholds the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Caution and Reſerve, It <hi>ſhould give Room,</hi> and be, as it were, the <hi>Stage for theſe Judgments of God to have their Play in and upon,</hi> They are ſo.</p>
               <p>So though to die be now the ordinarieſt, and moſt certain Thing in the World, an Ordinance, and a Debt to Nature, as we call it; vet <hi>Adam</hi> was not made to Dye, and to Dye is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Juſtice, if conſider'd according to the Original Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Indeed, becauſe the Mediator undertook no further, but that it is, as the Apoſtle ſays, Fixed, Determined, Enacted, that All Men ſhould dye, it is no Miracle; nor that any of the other Unhappineſſes common to Men, befall Men, do we account them Miracles.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:135384:18"/>
               <p> But the Things we account Miracles, are either the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, Sudden, and Immediate <hi>Strokes of Wrath and Juſtice;</hi> as thoſe on the Old World; on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> on thoſe Impure Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſtruck with Blindneſs; the Plagues on <hi>Pharoah;</hi> on <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the ſtroke of immediate Death by Fire from the Lord; the ſwallowing up <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>

               <p>On the other ſide, the Benefits God daily loadeth the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men of all Kinds with, we account not Miracles; but the Raiſing the Dead by <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha;</hi> the Multiplying the <hi>Widows Oyl; the Healing the Leproſie of Naaman;</hi> the <hi>preſerving Jonah</hi> from the Sea, in ſo wonderful an <hi>Ark</hi> as the <hi>Whales Belly;</hi> What is ſaid of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 24. when It is ſaid, <hi>The Fame of him went out throughout all Syria;</hi> And <hi>they brought unto him all ſick perſons; thoſe which were poſſeſs'd with Devils; thoſe which were Lunatick, and had the Palſy, and he healed them; his opening the Eyes of the Blind, cleanſing the Lepers, making the Lame to walk, the Dumb to ſpeak, the Deaf to hear;</hi> the giving to <hi>ſpeak with Tongues, to Interpret ſtrange Tongues:</hi> But above all, <hi>Raiſing the Dead</hi> appears to All perfect Miracle; the Raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> when Dead Three Days: <hi>John</hi> 11. 14. ſo alarm'd the <hi>Jews,</hi> and affrighted the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> who ſat in Counſel upon it, that they ſaid, <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe on hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus I have labour'd in this Firſt and Fundamental Point, to define the Nature of Miracle; becauſe it will give Light all along the Diſcourſe, and guide to the chief Point; viz. <hi>That they a pertain to the Kingdom of Chriſt, and World to come.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I Find it neceſſary to come up yet cloſer and nearer to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Scripture-Miracles, or its Account of them; and that ſo, that I may ſhew how cloſe they lead up to that <hi>World to come.</hi> And herein I ſhall obſerve moſt particularly the Words the Spirit of God uſes to expreſs Miracles by. I will to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe inſiſt on theſe Five Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Firſt Thing that ſpeaks Miracle, and that is indeed the moſt Proper and Eſſential Deſcription of Miracles, is, That in Miracle God acts by an immediate Hand, and does not work by any <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>Subordinate Cauſe,</hi> whatever Inſtrument, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, or Miniſter of his Power, he may uſe: When he works perfectly, as the <hi>Creator,</hi> he is alone, and there is no other with him in his Work: He ſhews himſelf immediately by his own Hand, and ſtretched out Arm: If God bleſſes Phyſick, and the ſick man is recovered, This is indeed Miracle, if we conſider the Firſt Spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is at the Fountain of All M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans; For he is the Firſt Cauſe. When a Man by Diligence in his Calling grows Rich; This Men ſay is no Miracle; He was a Diligent, and an Induſtrious, Laborious Man; and he had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe and theſe Opportunities: But if we believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, This is not to be attributed to the Second Cauſe, but to the Firſt; and in that, it is Miracle; For <hi>The Bleſſing of the Lord maketh Rich;</hi> and <hi>The Lord maketh Thee to grow R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch,</hi> as we Read in <hi>Moſes;</hi> and <hi>a man to whom God giveth Riches,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> But yet the Scripture it ſelf does not call this Miracle, becauſe a Train of Second Cauſes waits upon the Firſt, and to a common Eye hides it: In Miracle God does All; and he works like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135384:19"/> ſuddenly, and not according to the Leiſure and Slowneſs of the Second Cauſe; He heals immediately; He pour'd Riches on <hi>Solomon,</hi> like the <hi>moſt High Poſſeſſor of All;</hi> He <hi>commands,</hi> and the Effect <hi>ſtands up together,</hi> in the ſame <hi>moment he commands:</hi> If a Man hath <hi>Cataracts</hi> on his Eyes, and goes to a Skillful <hi>Oculiſt,</hi> and he <hi>Couches</hi> them, as we ſpeak; we do not call this Miracle, becauſe an Hand of Natural Cauſe waits upon God here for Concurrence; But when by the Power of Chriſt Men had their Eyes op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned, without the uſe of Means, Then Every One agrees It is the Hand of God, and calls it Miracle.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, This is One Thing in Miracle; and I beſeech the ſerious Conſideration of it, becauſe there is ſuch aſſurance in Scripture, God will come to do great Things immediately by his own Hand; He will do them, as he ſaid, he would <hi>Anſwer</hi> the Idolatrous Enquirers in <hi>Ezekiel, by Himſelf,</hi> by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power.</p>
               <p>According to this we are inſtructed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>When I ſtretch out my Hand,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>upon Aegypt.</hi> Miracle is the <hi>ſtretching out of God's Hand;</hi> and <hi>Chap</hi> 8. 19. when the <hi>Magicians</hi> could not do what <hi>Moſes</hi> did, They then ſaid, <hi>This is the Finger of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is the Nature of Miracle; It is <hi>God's</hi> ſhewing his <hi>own Finger:</hi> The <hi>Magicians</hi> acted by a Power, as we ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain; They acted by the Devil. But when <hi>Aaron ſmote the Duſt of the Earth, and it became Lice,</hi> Then the <hi>Magicians</hi> themſelves acknowledged, <hi>This is the Finger of God;</hi> becauſe they <hi>tryed to do ſo with their Enchantments, and could not.</hi> This therefore pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly declares Miracle, when it comes to that, that no Angelical Power can do it, nor can he truſted to do it, as <hi>God's Commiſſioner;</hi> Then it is Miracle; Then it is <hi>a Power of the World to come,</hi> which <hi>God hath not put into Subjection to Angels,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Good or Bad.</hi> The <hi>Magicians</hi> acting by the <hi>Intervention,</hi> and <hi>utmoſt Power of Bad Angels,</hi> did ſome Things, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> ſo long they did not own Miracle: But when they come to that, They acting by, Created Power could not do, nor were any way Commiſſion'd to do; Then they cryed out, <hi>The Finger of God.</hi> And it is very obſervable, our Lord makes uſe of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame word, in arguing the Truth of that ſo great Miracle of Caſting out that Potent Devil, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. by the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and not as the <hi>Magicians,</hi> by the <hi>Power of Belzebub,</hi> or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as the <hi>Magicians</hi> did. <hi>If I by the Finger of God caſt out Devils,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>then no doubt the Kingdom of God is come upon you;</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:135384:19"/> Where are Two Things moſt Remarkable concerning Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Miracles are by the immediate Power of God Patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Effected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a certain, undoubted, and inſeparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> or the <hi>World to come,</hi> and Miracles, or Effects of the Immediate Divine Power, or Finger, which ſhall indeed bring it in; All in it being <hi>Higheſt Power,</hi> and ſo is All, that works for it.</p>
               <p>There is therefore a peculiar Word choſen by the Spirit of God in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> to Expreſs Miracle by; and it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Power;</hi> ſo very often in Scripture; and moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably Miracles are call'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>Powers of the World to come.</hi> Now I find by the Conſent of the moſt Sage Interpreters, Thoſe <hi>Powers of the World to come,</hi> are underſtood of Miracles; They are Powers Demonſtrative of Immediate Divine Power, and <hi>Powers proper to the World to come,</hi> prepar'd for all manner of Service to it; and which ſhall in the Due and Juſt Time intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it; and, as I obſerved before, we find the ſame Expreſſion taken out of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 4. They are the <hi>Hand of God ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and his Arm,</hi> as Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>made Bare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Arm of God</hi> have Natural Means or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes to attend and wait on their Motion, then <hi>his Hand</hi> is <hi>not ſtretched out</hi> to the utmoſt Length or Line of Action, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Effect; but it adds the Line of the Action of thoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, though but a Cypher without him; yet he being before them, in them, with them, they are of Value; and ſo his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Arm</hi> are <hi>Cloathed, Shrowded,</hi> with theſe, as we call them, <hi>Natural Cauſes,</hi> and not <hi>Naked and Bare.</hi> There is another Expreſſion, whereby alſo this Immediate Power is made known to us; and that is uſed, <hi>Dan</hi> 2. 34, 45. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Without Hand;</hi> And ſo it is uſed in Caſes of Cloſe Connexion with the <hi>World to come,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135384:20"/> Power of God. In the ſame manner it is us'd of a <hi>Circumciſion made without Hands,</hi> Col. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Now in All Theſe, it is moſt Evident, This manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is on purpoſe choſen by the Divine Spirit to impart to us Immediate, Divine, and Miraculous Power; ſo it Equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Things <hi>not of This World, not of This Frame, not of This Building,</hi> but that have intimate and undivided Connexion with the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt, and World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our Lord Chriſt therefore, when he <hi>Opened the Eyes of the Blind,</hi> when he <hi>Healed the Sick,</hi> when he <hi>Reſtored the Lame,</hi> when he ſent out <hi>Apoſtles to Preach in All Languages,</hi> he did not call for the Curious Oculiſt, the Learned Phyſician, the Skillful Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, the Learned Linguiſts to help him, or to haſten to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct in all Tongues: He wrought all <hi>without Hands:</hi> When he works by his Grace, in the Hearts of his Servants, to make them New Creatures by that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> made without Hands; when he <hi>prepares the place of his Servants,</hi> Builds the <hi>Palace of his Kingdom;</hi> when he breaks <hi>his Enemies, He does All without Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you know, as among Men, One of the Chief Meaſures for Every Building, is by <hi>Fingers and Hands,</hi> and ſo on; and for Every Enterpriſe, and Undertaking, we ſtill account, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hands are prepared to work in it; So the Wars that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the World, They are wag'd by the <hi>Hands of the Men of Might;</hi> They <hi>finding their Hands,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, the <hi>Hands Taught to VVar,</hi> and the <hi>Fingers to fight.</hi> And they that have Moſt, and Ableſt Hands; we fore-ſpeak to them the Greateſt Succeſs. At this Day we are ready to ſay, ſuch a Prince is ſo mighty, has ſo many Hands; who is able to contend with him? How Significant therefore is this Expreſſion of Almighty Power <hi>working without hands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remember therefore, This is One of the Eſſentials of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; It is the <hi>Finger of God;</hi> it is the <hi>Hand of God ſtretched out;</hi> it is the <hi>Arm of God made Bare;</hi> it is <hi>working without Hands,</hi> or that (as ſome Learned interpret of <hi>the Stone cut out of the Mountains)</hi> is <hi>not in any Hands;</hi> the Managements as to him are not entruſted to any Humane Created <hi>Hand;</hi> he works all by himſelf without <hi>Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in All theſe Expreſſions it appears Miracle is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135384:20"/> Room of Things; yet if we could, we ſhould find, that all the Springs of Motion, and Action, of Life, yea, of very Being, are without <hi>Hand;</hi> and ſo Miracle is in Every Thing, Power is in Every Thing; and ſo here what we call Miracle, and no Miracle, does not differ; till Things come more into the Great Hall of this World, where Millions of <hi>Hands,</hi> or <hi>Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> are at work; So that the Difference upon the whole, in what we call Miracle, and not Miracle, is, That in Miracle <hi>Power without Hand</hi> goes all the way; In Things not Miracle, <hi>Created Hands</hi> take from God their ſhare of Action and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and hereupon we attribute All; through our Stupidity, Carnality and Unbelief, to Created Hands; and God is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, his Hand Covered and Shrouded: God therefore <hi>ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es out his Hand</hi> in Miracle, He lifts up <hi>his Hand,</hi> and <hi>makes Bare his Arm,</hi> and Forces Men to ſay, <hi>This is the Finger of God.</hi> But becauſe God does not this Every Day, but ſeldom hitherto, therefore a Second Character of Miracle ariſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Miracle is properly ſomething, that in regard of the Newneſs, and unuſualneſs of it, makes Men Gaze, and look upon it with Wonder and Admiration; and from this Paſſion it raiſes in Men, it is call'd, <hi>Wonder,</hi> or <hi>Miracle;</hi> and becauſe Men are Alarm'd, and Expect ſome Great Event upon it, it is call'd <hi>Sign,</hi> or <hi>Portent,</hi> in the Sacred Language of both the <hi>New and Old Teſtament.</hi> Two Words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> denote <hi>Signs,</hi> and another expreſſes <hi>VVonder;</hi> and ſo in the <hi>Greek,</hi> ſometimes Miracles are remark'd to us by a Word properly rendered <hi>Sign,</hi> and ſometimes by a Word ſignifying <hi>VVonder and ſurpriſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though I have before Aſſerted, That herein alſo the Works of God, though conſtant and perpetual, are yet alſo New and Freſh; our Life, Health, Freedom, All we Enjoy, are <hi>Freſh Mercies and Compaſſions, New Every morning,</hi> every moment: They are not the Mercies we had yeſterday, but <hi>New mercies:</hi> I deſire this Remark may be upon all our Hearts, to raiſe us to Thankfulneſs, Dependence, ſelf Reſignation, and Obedience; yet becauſe theſe Every-days mercies of God, we ſeem to hold by a more conſtant Tenure of Providence, <hi>that exerciſeth Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs on the Earth,</hi> Scripture it ſelf calls Miracles of Mercy or Judgment, <hi>New Things;</hi> what God does in Mercy or in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure ordinarily, we are ſo acquainted with, and they look ſo like one another, that we look not upon them, as new; but when God does thoſe great things, we call Miracles, we are in a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135384:21"/> Wonder, at an Amaze, we ask what is this a ſign of? nay if things unuſual fall out, and appear, although we account the things not Miracles, but Wonders; as a <hi>Comet</hi> in the Heavens, great <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> ſtrange <hi>Inundations, Earth quakes;</hi> we are Alarm'd, and Mov'd, and are ready to look for ſome extraordinary Things coming upon the Earth; And unuſual Events in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, either of Mercy or Affliction, make great Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men as to their expectations.</p>
               <p>And herein, ſo far as God permits him, the Devil is as often as he can, doing Wonders, or ſtrange Things; and ſo are his Miniſters, either by, or without his <hi>known help,</hi> of which ſort are all the Antichriſtian Signs and Lying Wonde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Restitution</hi> is; to give warning, to make Credit, and Aſſurance of Theſe, even of Both; and therefore, as I have already Argued, and ſhall much further Argue in the Part of this Diſcourſe allotted to it; That <hi>Miracles are Powers of the World to come,</hi> every way proper and peculiar to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Miracles are therefore Conjoyned with ſome Eminent, and Notable Appearance of the <hi>World to Come;</hi> As at the bringing of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135384:22"/> the <hi>People of Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> and into <hi>the Land of Canaan, the Promiſed Land;</hi> and ſo when Chriſt was here in the World, and the Apoſtles ſo Preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, as if it had been immediately to appear; and ſo much more when that Kingdom ſhall indeed appear; <hi>For elſe Miracles would be as Seals to a Blanck;</hi> This therefore Detects <hi>all Falſe Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Lying Wonders,</hi> that they are not in purſuance of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> And this is moſt Evident, as was ſaid before, by our Saviours In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the Truth of that mighty work of <hi>Caſting out the Deaf and Dumb Devil,</hi> and that is was done by the <hi>Finger of God;</hi> that no <hi>doubt, the Kingdom of God was come upon them,</hi> as he ſhews: <hi>Luke</hi> 11. For <hi>Miracles</hi> cannot be without the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in Eminent Appearance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Miracles muſt, being Parts, and Peices of the World to come, give greateſt Aſſurance of themſelves to be the mighty works of God; this Aſſurance muſt be given to the whole man, to the Mind, Underſtanding, inward and outward Senſes; for this is Aſſurance to the whole Man. The Underſtanding is oft un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Error, and miſtake, wherein it is not Serv'd, and Miniſtred to by Senſe; Senſe is oft deluded, when the mind does not make a Judgment. When both make a full Judgment, This is as great Aſſurance, as the Intellectual, ſenſible Being of Man is capable of; and therefore Reſiſtance to ſuch Light is <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> againſt full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Divine Power, and Appearance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 10. The Miracles therefore proper to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> are Armed at all Points by <hi>Infallible Proofs,</hi> as that grand Miracle of the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt was, Acts</hi> 1. 3. And thus they ought to be from their Relation to the Kingdom of Chriſt, which ſhall give all aſſurance of it ſelf to the whole Man, and for ever remove all poſſibility of doubt from Saints, who ſhall ſee then <hi>Eye to Eye;</hi> and from wicked Men, who <hi>would not ſee, but ſhall ſee in that day.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Reaſons, or ends of Miracles, as they are generally Aſſign'd by thoſe, who have Writ upon them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Come now to ſhew the Ends, and great Uſes, and Purpoſes of God in Miracles, what he intends towards the Children of men by them.</p>
               <p>And I will Argue the thing Freely, both on the one ſide, and the other; becauſe I know, the generality of Chriſtians, and of the Interpreters and Teachers of the Doctrine of Miracles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all Judgments, and perſuaſions, are very narrow, and confined in their Apprehenſions concerning the Reaſons, or ends of Miracles; and have not conſider'd this great End of them, their relation to the <hi>World to come,</hi> or to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Far be it from me to take upon me, but I ſay; By evidence from the Word of God, it will appear, that this is the far greateſt End of Miracles, which hath been Overſeen, not conſidered, nor looked into, altho the <hi>Head of the Corner;</hi> and yet other Ends or Reaſons of them are to be duly conſidered alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A great end of Miracles is to call Men to an immediate Conſideration of God; For Men can put off God in Ordinary Things, and ſay, Nature did it; this or that Natural Cauſe; Did you not ſee, ſay they, how this, or that Natural Cauſe wrought; and take away (ſay they) the Natural Cauſe, and the Effect will not be produced. As if a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>lies ſtill, and does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he doth not grow Rich, if he had not Riches, and an Eſtate before; and ſo let a man be under a Diſeaſe, if he does not ſend for a Phyſician, then Nature, and the Diſeaſe muſt Conteſt it, and diſpute it together; and it is odds againſt Nature,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135384:23"/> it will be overcome; if you take away the Fire, ſay they, there ſhall be no Warmth; if you take away the Sun, there can be no Light; ſo men leave God out; and therefore to awaken Bruitiſh Men, that do not conſider God is at the Spring of all, and that he concurs with all, that Reaches any End; God very often croſſes, and thwarts what we count the Courſe of Natural Cauſes, <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong, nor Bread to the Wiſe, nor Favour to the Men of understanding, but the Wiſe, and their Works are in the Hands of God, the God of Nature;</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>All this notwithſtanding, moſt men do not perceive; God therefore hath not been wanting to the World to give ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Appearances, and to make himſelf known by a <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Arm ſtretched out, and made bare;</hi> and it is a great Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if Men do not take notice hereof. This was the great ſin of <hi>Pharoh,</hi> that he harden'd his Heart againſt all thoſe mighty Works of God done before him, and upon him. This ſin highly provoked God againſt the <hi>Iſraelites, That they ſaw his Works forty years, and yet always Err'd in their Hearts, and did not know the ways of God,</hi> Heb. 3. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. So ſays Chriſt, <hi>If I had not come, and done among them the works, that no other Man did, They had had no ſin, but now they have both ſeen and hated, both me, and my Father,</hi> John 15. 24.</p>
               <p>From all this, It is very Evident, Miracles ought to be vehement Perſuaſions to Faith, Love, Obedience, Self-Reſignation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Manifeſtation of God to Men, with which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles go along; But yet conſider on the other ſide, That though this is one great end of Miracles, yet it is not worthy to be the chief, or Adequate End of Miracles; For let theſe two or three things ſtand in Counter-ballance to ſuppoſing ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the general Works of God, and thoſe in ordinary, or Conſtancy, are ſo great, that Men are <hi>without excuſe,</hi> in not Fearing God, and Loving, and Obeying him, altho there had never been a Miracle in extraordinary in the World; as I have ſhewn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The inviſible things of God, even his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, and Godhead</hi> are ſo manifeſt from the Creation; All Men who do not <hi>Glorify him as God, and who ſerve the Creature, more than the Creator bleſſed for ever, are without excuſe;</hi> if God had not done enough without Miracles, then indeed there would certainly have been Miracles upon this only account, that men might have no juſt Reaſon to complain of God.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:135384:23"/>
               <p> And ſo let us conſider that of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>Who would not fear thee? Oh Lord, King of Nations; For to thee doth it appertain; For as much as there is none like unto thee; For thou art Great, and thy Name is great in might: When he uttereth his Voice, There is a multitude of Waters in the Heavens; And will ye not fear me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>who have placed the Sand for a Bound to the Sea, that though the Waters toſs themſelves they cannot paſs over;</hi> Are ye ſo Bruitiſh, ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo unreaſonable, that ye will not fear me? Every day God doth <hi>Great Things and Miracles, and that without number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not therefore, that God hath not given Evidence enough, for he hath given abundantly enough; yea, though Men had not the Light of his Word, They are without <hi>Excuſe;</hi> How much more are they <hi>without Excuſe,</hi> who have the Light of that, even of the <hi>Goſpel of Glory!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not deny, that God makes a greater Offer of himſelf by Miracles, conſidering Mens great Stupidity; They are to excite them, who <hi>Believe not,</hi> I grant; yet I am much perſwaded, there is ſo much, enough and to ſpare of Evidence and Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, that if that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en the ſole end of Miracles to offer a further Evidence or Motive of acknowledging God; if there had not been a greater End, than that, There had never been a Miracle in the World ſhewn on that Account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be well weighed, that as Chriſt ſays, <hi>If I had not done among them, the Works that no other Man did, they had had no ſin:</hi> So he ſays, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, but now they have no Cloak for their Sin; tho he ſhould have done no Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That alſo weighs much with me; That the great End of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is not to Convince Men, or move them home to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>ult. They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, if they will not believe them, neither will they be perſwaded, though one Roſe from the Dead.</hi>

               <p>I am very confident, Take any man of the Family, where there has been a great deal of Wickedneſs, and Prophaneneſs, and looſneſs of Living; and ſo the Courts, where there has been ſucceſſive Debauchery, careleſſneſs of all Religion, abundance of Pride, Luxury, and Senſuality; and if God ſhould bring back any of thoſe Princes, or Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore Argues to me; To move Men to Converſion, and Repentance is not the proper, and Adequate Reaſon of Miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would further ſtrengthen this by the obſervation of the Behaviour of thoſe, to whom Miracles were more immediately Directed; and we may find, how they ſtood up like Rock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Force of them, as we ſee in <hi>Pharoh;</hi> Would any one think God ſhould ſend upon him <hi>Ten Miraculous Plagues,</hi> one after another, to take him down, and bring him into Subjection to God; and that at laſt we ſhould find him <hi>Driving into the Heart of the Sea,</hi> after the People of God, and then overwhelmed; the ſin God had ſo often warn'd him of, and Plagued him for; and yet thus it was: I acknowledg <hi>God</hi> magnified his Power, and got himſelf a <hi>great Name</hi> in his Deſtruction; but we may ſee there was a further Relation to the <hi>World to come,</hi> by the Recalling the <hi>Song of</hi> Moſes <hi>at the Red Sea,</hi> the place of his <hi>Periſhing,</hi> and Joyning it with the Song of the <hi>Lamb;</hi> and by the paralel Courſe of the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> deſtroying Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> as was before intimated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner the Miracles of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles were Directed firſt, and immediately on the Jews of That time; But how little they Avail'd to Converſion, we know beyond Doubt; I do not deny, <hi>God</hi> Juſtified himſelf more abundantly thereby in their utter Deſtruction by the <hi>Romans,</hi> about forty years after; But the Intereſt the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> prevail'd beyond that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> End of Converſion, For It Faild; But when that was

               <p n="3">3. The moving men home to God cannot be the adequate end of Miracles: God hath been pleaſed to bring ſome Home ſuddenly without Miracle; as <hi>Matthew the Publican, Matt.</hi> 9. 9. and the Apoſtle prefers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Prophecy</hi> or Powerful Preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as above <hi>Miracles</hi> for the End of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or a more Spiritual, Inward, Miraculous Power above a Miracle that ſeems more wonderful to ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Speaking</hi> with all manner of <hi>Tongues,</hi> or <hi>

               <p n="2">2. It is aſſigned, as a much more Agreable, and Commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate end of Miracles, that they are Given as a Teſtimony from Heaven of the truth of any Divine Revelation from Heaven, of the will, and mind of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Touching any Law, or Rule of Faith, worſhip and Life in order to Eternal Life, eſpecially when the Points of that <hi>Revelation</hi> are above, over, and ſuper-added to the Law and Light, which we Call, of Nature; or to any former <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> and <hi>Declaration of the Will of God,</hi> that had been fixed and ſetled in the Church, and among the People of God throughout their <hi>Generations;</hi> ſuch <hi>Miraculous Power</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given into the Hand of ſuch <hi>Miniſters of Divine Pleaſure,</hi> as he hath Choſen for it.</p>
               <p>Thus a great <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Divine Power</hi> was with <hi>Moſes, the Servant of God,</hi> in the fixing that whole Frame of the <hi>Ceremonial Law;</hi> Thus the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of it was fill'd with the glorious coming down of God into it; ſo <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was, as we may ſay, Conſecrated by God himſelf.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Death of, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>ſtupendious Miracle</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> when the <hi>Lord Bruiſed, and put him to Grief, and made his Soul an Offering for Sin.</hi> This foreſhewed the Dread of the Vengeance of God for ſin, <hi>burning upon the wicked to the Neithermoſt Hell, ſetting on Fire the Foundation of the Mountains, Burning up the Earth, and the Works of it, and the wicked becoming as Bryars and Thorns Burnt on that their own Earth.</hi> For as Chriſt ſaid in a Foreſight of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem, If theſe things were done in the Green Tree, what ſhall be done in the Dry!</hi> This ought to be carried to all Deſolations, and Deſtructions, the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Righteous Judgment of God</hi> ſhall make in his <hi>Holy Indignation,</hi> againſt the Poſterity, and World of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Adam</hi> not Reconciled by the <hi>Second Adam, The Lord from Heaven, and Father of the world to Come, whereof we ſpeak.</hi>

               <p>The Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as all that ſpeak of Miracle, acknowledg, is a Glorious Pledg <hi>of the World to Come,</hi> and an entry into the very State of it; This World knew no ſuch thing before, nor had any ſuch

               <p>Now there is nothing, wherein I can more Humbly and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly Intreat you, that Read theſe Things; and wherein you can yeild a greater Acceptance, to what I am now Diſcourſing, than that you would Search theſe things, and Compare them, and Argue them to your ſelves; For I know they will, and muſt bear weight with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The Second Argument, I would give you, is the Conſideration of the way, by which God will ſave All, and every one of us, whom he will ſave by the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and fits them for that <hi>World to Come, for that everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He ſaves them, he does all for them in a way of Miracle.</p>
               <p>This I will endeavour to make plain to you, by conſidering, That God would not ſave Men by the Firſt Covenant, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Creation, the Law of Creation; They cannot be Saved by that; They muſt be ſaved by a <hi>New Covenant,</hi> a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that is all Miracle.</hi> This I will ſhew you in two Parts of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God Juſtifies Sinners by the Righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Obedience and by the Suffering, and by the Death of another; This is Miracle; and it is as great Miracle, as any of the Things, that Men allow to be Miracle; and indeed in Regard of the Internal Excellency, the Intrinſick worth of the Thing, It is far greater than any Miracle, except what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the very Excellency, and Glory of the Perſon of the Mediator; Thoſe Wonders of Miracle, if I may ſo ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore that we could conſider it; If we are Pardoned in Chriſt, if we are Juſtified by Chriſt, If we are Saved from Hell, from Wrath to come by him, or from the <hi>Curſe of the Law;</hi> This is all Miracle; For I would Ask any Man; I am ſure,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135384:29"/> None of the Men of Reaſon, and that ſeem to underſtand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle Beſt, can deny it; Is not Miracle a Lifting up of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the World above the firſt Law, and Order of the Creation; ſure this cannot be Denied; Now that Law of Righteouſneſs, that was given to Man at firſt; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Work</hi> was the very Foundation of the Firſt Creation, Man made in <hi>Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and True Holineſs;</hi> and then working according to it, acting from and by himſelf, according to the Law of his Creation. I doubt not indeed, that Man was made with the Knowledge of Chriſt, the Mediator of Amity, and Conciliation, and Suſtentation, in the ſtate wherein he was made; ſeeing all things were made by and for our Mediator; and that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was the <hi>Type of him to come;</hi> and the <hi>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> and of the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> pointed to him; and the very <hi>Image</hi> wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was made, was <hi>Chriſt the Image of God.</hi> But this being not of the preſent Intention, I only intimate, and ſtand not to prove it; But <hi>Adam</hi> not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the Mediator, was wholly upon his own Bottom of Creation, and the Self Subſiſtence he choſe out of a Mediator: Whatever therefore God does in Grace, through a Mediator, to Man Fallen, is Miracle of Grace; and though it may ſeem in all Spiritual Concernments, the Concernments of the Inward Man, there is not Miracle, becauſe they do not at the preſent come into ſenſe; yet in regard of the preſent ſtate, they are of as Real Inward Deep Senſe, and Peace of Conſcience; and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Evidence in the Change of the Life and Converſation; and

               <p>Now then if it come to Grace, and to Faith to receive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by another, it muſt needs be Miracle: We are ſaved by Miracle in the pardon of ſin, and being accepted through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; I think the Apoſtle guides us to this very Apprehenſion; <hi>For what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son, and for ſin condemned ſin in the Fleſh,</hi> ſo that <hi>it might not be imputed to the Believer in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 3.</p>
               <p>I would but parallel it thus; A Man is Blind, or Lame, or Sick, or Lunatick, or any of thoſe things we read of in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; All the Power of Nature ſummoned together, the whole <hi>Colledge of Phyſicians,</hi> and of all the Wiſe Men in Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummoned together, they could not have healed a Man <hi>born Blind;</hi> They could not have interpoſed in the Caſe of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at all, much leſs in an Inſtant, as Chriſt healed them in the Inſtant.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, what Nature could not do, and all the Power of Art joyn'd with it, could not do, that God, <hi>ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh,</hi> did; <hi>He hore away our Sickneſſes, carried our Sorrows,</hi> ſo as to heave them off from us upon himſelf; This we greedily enough allow to be Miracle.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, whatever the Law, the Eternal Rule of Righteouſneſs cannot, in regard of the Sinfulneſs and Guilt of the Nature, and of the Tranſgreſſions and Iniquities of Men, do, in the point of Juſtification before G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot forbear to take notice, That the great Men of <hi>Free-will</hi> are the greateſt Arguers of the Truth of Chriſtianity by <hi>Miracles;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, they are as much puzzl'd, and Blunder as much concerning the very <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Regenerating Grace,</hi> the <hi>Regenerating Spirit,</hi> as this great Man <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did; It is true, to hear them ſpeaking of it, as it is not Miracle, but according to the Law of the Firſt Creation, or very little Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, They may ſpeak more Tollerably of it.</p>
               <p>But ſaith our Lord to him, <hi>That which is Born of the Fleſh is Fleſh:</hi> According to the Law of the Firſt Creation, Let Fleſh be your Spring, and Well-Head, you ſhall never riſe above it, do what you can; Therefore <hi>marvel not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſaid, you muſt be Born again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This Regeneration is by the <hi>Spirit</hi> alone, no man can Beget himſelf, but he muſt needs beget himſelf the very ſame, He was before; The New Birth is, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, the Child of Promiſe. It is as the Birth of our Lord, and ſeveral of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors was, by Miracle. He can Communicate no New prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to himſelf; And juſt, as the Apoſtle ſays here; <hi>Divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will;</hi> So in this Miracle of Regeneration, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Spirit bloweoh where it Liſteth;</hi> To ſhew, It is all immediate power, that is, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>

               <p>I would ask any one, whether this is Miracle or not? If it be only according to the Law of the Firſt Creation, It is not Miracle, but if it be entirely, and perfectly a new Creation, It muſt needs be Miracle.</p>

               <p>Now that the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom of the Reſurrection of all his Servants, is plain;</hi> For he <hi>Roſe Firſt;</hi> His Saints <hi>Riſe at his Coming,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 23 His <hi>Coming,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom are Conjoyn'd,</hi> 2 Tim 4. 1.

Now theſe <hi>Lived; They Lived and they Reign'd with Chriſt a Thouſand years;</hi> And the <hi>reſt of the Dead,</hi> That is, all thoſe who were not in a State of Bleſſed Life, but under the <hi>Condemnation of Chriſt, during the Thouſand Years; They Lived not again, after the Thouſand Years were fulfilled; This is the firſt Reſurrection, the Kingdom of the Reſurrection. Bleſſed and Holy is he, who hath his Part in this Firſt Reſurrection, as all the Living, Remaining Saints have; Over them the Second Death ſhall have no Power; For they in a Paradiſiac State, on the New Earth, chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bodies of Paradiſe, are Prieſts of God and Christ, for the Thouſand Years; Fitted to be Caught up, and to be together with the Saints Dead in Chriſt, Raiſed to Enjoy the Kingdom of the Reſurrection; as the Children of the Reſurrection, the Principals of the Firſt Reſurrection in the New Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often Heard, and Read the Diſcourſes of the Men of Reaſon, Magnifying the Reſurrection, as is moſt Due; <hi>As the Hand of God ſtretched out in the Higheſt manner, as the Greatest of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> But, oh, why ſhould they not follow on to the <hi>Kingdom of the Reſurrection, the World to Come of the Reſurrection,</hi> during its <hi>Thouſand Years; the New Creation, the New Heaven, the New Earth,</hi>

                  <hi>the Kingdom of all Miracle;</hi> and then <hi>All delivered up to God and the Father, that he may be All in All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For from all this I conclude, the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all Miracle;</hi> Every Miracle therefore that hath been in this World, is but a Peice, a Parcel, a Portion of that ſo vaſt, and entire Sum.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. I have now Argued, <hi>The New Creation, The New Heaven,</hi> and <hi>the New Earth</hi> are certainly Miracle; becauſe above the Conſtitution, and Law of the Firſt Creation; and that therefore all Miracle is but part, and parcel, a peice, and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Great State of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt: For he that is upon the Throne,</hi> ſays, <hi>Behold I Create all New.</hi> And he adds, <hi>Write, For theſe Words are True and Faithful;</hi> Why did he ſay ſo? But becauſe he knew very well what an Oppoſition, what a contrary Sentiment, even Chriſtians would be of to this Truth; <hi>Be aſſur'd therefore,</hi> ſaith the Great Prince upon the Throne, <hi>Theſe Things are Faithful and True,</hi> and ſhall have their full Accompliſhment in their own proper Times.</p>
               <p>But now, as there is in <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſo Miraculous a State of Mercy, and of Grace to his Servants; ſo there is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous State of Judgment, Deſolating, and Diſſolving the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of this World; even, as it is upheld now by the Grace of the Mediator; and that in the Introducing the <hi>World to Come, whereof we ſpeak;</hi> and alſo to ſettle ſuch a Counter-ſtate of Wrath, and Judgment, wherein all the Wicked that have been in the World, ſhall be in a moſt Viſible State of Contempt and Diſhonour, <hi>under the wrath of God and the Lamb.</hi> And of this, all the Judgments that have been hitherto in the World, have been Parts, Peices, and Portions; alſo Pawns, and Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of that State.

For a Summary or Recapitulating Argument, we may look back on ſome of the moſt Remarkable Miraculous Appearances of God in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and ſee what an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Correſpondence they bear to the <hi>World to Come, or to the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Christ; as the Tranſlation of Enoch, that he ſhould not ſee Death,</hi> Gen. 5. 22. Heb. 11. 5. That, we know was perfect Miracle, compar'd with the Preſent State of Dying; <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha's Raiſing the Dead, Types</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> 1 Kings 17. 17. 2 Kings 4 28. The <hi>Dividing the Red-Sea,</hi> and <hi>Jordan, Types</hi> of the ſmiting the <hi>Egyptian River</hi> in the <hi>Seven Streams, and Deſtroying the Tongue of it, making men go over Dry ſhod, and of a High way for his People, as to Iſrael in the Day he came up out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> Eſay 11. 16. <hi>and Like Drying up the Deep, and the River, and the Pride of Egyptian and Aſſyrian Departing away; when all ſhall be ſtrengthen'd in God, and the people ſhall walk up and down in the Name of the Lord, Zech.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>&amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>But I would eſpecially have Reſpect to that Standard Miracle of the <hi>Sabbatical Year:</hi> A great Wonder of the Riches, and Might, and Power of God: Every <hi>Seventh Year</hi> there was a mighty ſhewing forth of the Power of God; For that the <hi>Earth brought forth it ſelf</hi> ſo much in the <hi>Sixth Year,</hi> that they might Live upon it without any Plowing, or Sowing the <hi>ſeventh Year.</hi> The <hi>ſeventh Year</hi> was to be a <hi>Sabbath of Reſt</hi> unto the Land, a <hi>Sabbath to the Lord;</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were neither to Sow <hi>their fields,</hi> nor to <hi>Prune their Vineyards,</hi> nor to <hi>Reap,</hi> nor to <hi>Gather,</hi> but all were to Live alike of what <hi>came forth of it ſelf:</hi> God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Bleſs the <hi>ſixth Year ſo,</hi> that It ſhould yeild meat for three years, that ſo the <hi>ſeventh year,</hi> might be a year of <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Reſt to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us Conſider, what the <hi>Prophets</hi> have ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>World to Come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> how exactly ſuitable, and agreeable to this they have ſpoken of the <hi>World to Come;</hi> From whence I Argue, and do appeal to any one, whether the Argument be not exceeding great; The <hi>ſeventh year</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> was a Symbol, was a Peice, Parcel, Portion of the <hi>World to Come, whereof we ſpeak,</hi> and of the great Sabbatiſm of it.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:135384:33"/>
               <p> Amos 9. 11. <hi>In that day will I Raiſe up the Tabernacle of David, that it may be Built, as in the days of Old; That they may poſſeſs the Remnant of Edom, and of all the Heathen, which are called by my Name, ſaith the Lord, that doth this.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that the Plowman ſhall overtake the Reaper, and the Treader of Grapes him that ſoweth Seed; and the Mountains ſhall drop ſweet VVine, and All the Hills ſhall melt</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earth, and the Mountains, and the Hills ſhall Flow out with a great Freedom, and Spontaneouſneſs into an abundance for the Servants of God; Then ſhall the full Senſe, and Meaning of the <hi>Sabbatical years</hi> be underſtood; Then ſhall the Full Sum, of which that was but a Part, and Portion, be brought into open View; Then inſtead of the <hi>Briar,</hi> and <hi>Thorn,</hi> ſhall grow up the <hi>Mirtle Tree,</hi> and the <hi>Fir Tree;</hi> And <hi>It ſhall be unto the Lord for a Sign, and a Memorial, that ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When our Lord was here in the <hi>Days of his Fleſh,</hi> he gave an Experiment of Divine Power to the ſame purpoſe; and it was a <hi>Miracle</hi> he ſeem'd to delight in; For he ſeveral Times Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; He <hi>fed with a few Loaves,</hi> and <hi>ſmall Fiſhes</hi> ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; and the <hi>Baskets</hi> of <hi>Fragments</hi> far exceeded the Principal, or very firſt Proviſion.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Things are all own'd to be Miracles, let us but ask our ſelves whether theſe things were not ſo? If we now in this Nation ſhould let Plowing, and Sowing alone, for a year, would we not look upon it as the Introduction of a Famine? but now if God ſhould poſitively command us, and Aſſure us; That there ſhould be care taken in any one year, for three years, and we ſhould Find it ſo taken, Would we not look upon it as Miracle?</p>
               <p>If any one ſhould Set down ſo great Numbers of People, as Chriſt did, to ſo ſmall a Proviſion, that every one could not take a little; ſhould we not look upon it with as great, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amazement, than the Apoſtles did upon Chriſts doing ſo? But if the ſmall Feaſt in the Beginning ſhould Multiply in the Eating, and become More, after a plentiful Eating, than it was before Eating, Should we not look upon it as a Miracle? Now All this Imports, That <hi>a Sufficiency of Food,</hi> and <hi>Durable Cloathing,</hi> ſhall be in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> that his Servants may <hi>Eat</hi> and be <hi>Satisfied, Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink at his Table in his Kingdom,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the <hi>Lord without Diſtraction;</hi> that is, <hi>Fulneſs of Enjoyment.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Great Readineſs of Chriſt, in ſhewing his Mercy and Power towards the <hi>Blind and Lame,</hi> that they might be ſo no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, makes me think of that <hi>Glory</hi> in the <hi>Book of Samuel,</hi> when it is ſaid of <hi>David; the Blind and the Lame, whom David's Soul hated.</hi> I only make an Alluſion, not conſidering the ſtrict Senſe: Jeſus Chriſt his <hi>Soul hated not the I ame, or the Blind;</hi> but <hi>the Blindneſs, and the Lameneſs, the Sickneſs and the Death:</hi> His <hi>Soul</hi> had ſuch a ſenſe, that this came upon the World, upon Mankind by ſin; That he Laboured and Travailed in Spirit, till he brought forth, as you know, ſo many great Inſtances of the <hi>Redemption of Mankind,</hi> in <hi>Carrying our Sorrows, and bearing our Sickneſſes,</hi> till there be that perfect <hi>Reſtitution of All Things</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before; and the <hi>Creatures,</hi> or <hi>Creation it ſelf,</hi> be <hi>Delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Manifeſtation of the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe things joyn'd together ſeem to me ſo full of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that my heart is, while I ſpeak of them, ſo ſatiated with them, that I cannot but hope they will be alſo moſt Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſatisfactory to them that read them; ſo as to conclude, how cloſe Miracle, and <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> are Related one to another; and that the Chief, and Adequate End, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Miracle is, that they are <hi>Portions and Parcels, Peices and Pledges of the Kingdom of Chriſt, or of the World to come,</hi> and ſhall bring it in at laſt.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Great <hi>Objection</hi> I find in my own Thoughts, and which Raiſes, and Confirms (I doubt not) in others a Reſolved Pre-judgment, that Miracles ſhall not Return, is; Becauſe, that now for a <hi>Thouſand, Two Hundred and Sixty Years,</hi> or near about, Miracles, except the <hi>Lying and Legendary ones,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy</hi>

               <p>The Time of the <hi>Going out of Egypt,</hi> from the <hi>Multiplication of the Children of Iſrael</hi> there, to the very ſettlement in <hi>Canaan,</hi> was one Continued Train of Miracles: Nor was the Time of the <hi>Judges</hi> or of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> Un-illuſtrated by various Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations of the mighty Power of God towards his People in Fore-Aſſurances of the <hi>Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> which is much to be Remark'd; Becauſe the Law of God, by his <hi>Servant Moſes,</hi> had Receiv'd the full ſettlement, and Eſtabliſhment by as high Teſtimonies from Heaven, as ſerv'd not only the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarineſs of its Sanction, but the Glory and Grandieur of it.

               <p>But that which is moſt Wonderful, and Deſerves particular Enquiry, is, That even in the Apoſtaſy of the Ten Tribes, beſides the Communication of whatſoever great things God did in the <hi>Kingdom of Judah;</hi> There were Thoſe two Prophets, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> like two <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſet out, and Credential'd with a Mighty Power of Miracles, to be as a Light ſhining <hi>in the Dark place of that Apoſtaſy,</hi> that was ſo great a <hi>Type of the Antichriſtian Apoſtaſy;</hi> and the <hi>Types</hi> of one are made by great Wiſdom of the Divine Spirit, Correſpondent to the Types of the other; even to ſo undoubted clearneſs, and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; that I make no doubt to Aſſign it, as one Reaſon, Why there was ſuch a Miraculous Preſence there, even that It,

               <p>But beſides that, There was with Regard to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of whom the <hi>Prophetick Benediction</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke ſo great Things; and who was ſo great a Type of Chriſt, in his High Adminiſtration in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and whoſe was, as the Spirit of God Teſtifies, the <hi>Birth-Right,</hi> 1 Chron. 5. 2. There was a Type, I ſay, of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> neceſſarily to be Erected in his peculiar Poſterity, whereof he himſelf Foretold in <hi>Ephraim;</hi> ſo that tho the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was <hi>Judah</hi>'s, and no one Good King of the <hi>Houſe of Joſeph</hi> over the <hi>Ten Tribes;</hi> yet God being pleaſed to have ſome Repreſentation of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> tho in ſo continued an <hi>Apoſtaſy;</hi> he was pleaſed alſo to Honour it with ſo peculiar a <hi>Prophetical Miniſtry;</hi> and that ſo Illuſtrated with Miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, till he gave them a <hi>Bill of Divorce</hi> under the Name of thoſe <hi>three Children of Whoredom, Jezreel, Lo-Ruhamah</hi> and <hi>Lo-Ammi, Hoſea</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe it was ſtill a Type of the Kingdom of Chriſt, There was an Eminent Type of the very <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt, Elijah carried up to Heaven,</hi> even above the <hi>Tranſlation of Enoch, in a Chariot of Fire, without Dying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some years after the <hi>Captivity of the Ten Tribes,</hi> when they were come under the very Perpendicular Influences of that Dreadful <hi>Lo Ruhamah,</hi> and <hi>Lo-Ammi,</hi> The Miraculous Power of God ſhone out with very Bright Rayes upon <hi>Hezekiah King of Judah,</hi> a moſt Excellent <hi>Reforming</hi> Prince; Firſt, in the Deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of ſo great an <hi>Aſſyrian Army;</hi> which threatn'd him with the Lot of the Ten Tribes; and Immediately after, with that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Sign in the <hi>Shadow;</hi> that is, as the Learned make manifeſt, <hi>The Sun going ſo many Degrees back, to aſſure his Life reſtor'd.</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135384:37"/> Power, the Power of Miracles being alſo Joyn'd with it, ſhall be abundantly given out; For <hi>John did no Miracle</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Prophecy</hi> was not in him <hi>Fullfill'd to the utmoſt;</hi> then ſhall <hi>indeed the Heart of the Fathers be Turn'd to the Children, and the Heart of the Children to the Fathers, or of the Diſobedient to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, in the mean time, The <hi>Beginning of the Goſpel, in every Evangeliſt, is plac'd in John,</hi> to whom ſays <hi>Luke, The Word of God</hi> by immediate Miſſion <hi>came; and he was a Man ſent from God,</hi> as the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> ſays; <hi>And the very Beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God is Fix'd in Him by Mark</hi> cap. 1. 1, 2 As if he would have Joyn'd the laſt words of <hi>Malachi,</hi> and the firſt of his own together, and in a <hi>Continuation,</hi> as one and the ſame <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, tho <hi>John</hi> was ſo great a <hi>Prophet; Yet he</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that is Leaſt in the Kingdom of God, is Greater than he;</hi> His <hi>Greatneſs above all,</hi> that <hi>were Born of Women ſtood in this, That he prepar'd the way to Chriſt,</hi> and to that great Power, with which the <hi>Son of God</hi> came: He was ſo Great in his being ſo near the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> yet becauſe he was ſo near, and not in that very <hi>Kingdom,</hi> It was not fit for him to do any Miracle; That was a Glory Proper only to the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> it ſelf Now it was juſt in its Appearance.</p>
               <p>And thus, I have brought Time down to its <hi>Fullneſs,</hi> juſt to that very point wherein our Lord Jeſus Chriſt Appearing, there were ſo great Reaſons of Expectation, that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould alſo have then <hi>Appear'd Immediately,</hi> and all Miracles have been ſumm'd up in its Coming with Power; But tho in the <hi>Days</hi> of thoſe <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> I mean of thoſe <hi>Four Monarchies in Daniel,</hi> that were ſo Determin'd by God and by Chriſt; a Room was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <hi>That the God of Heaven ſhould ſet up a Kingdom,</hi> and a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion never to End; yet it was in Infinite Wiſdom, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſo Determin'd, that it ſhould ſhew it ſelf, and its right, and ſo withdraw again; becauſe the laſt of the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> even the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> had that large Stage of Time allow'd to it to run over; and concerning the laſt State or Part of which Chriſt had <hi>Sworn,</hi> There ſhould be <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time,</hi> e're the Wonders, or Miracles proper to the Introducing his <hi>Kingdom ſhould be Finiſhed.</hi> Dan. 12. 6.</p>
               <p>However for that very Appearance of that <hi>Kingdom ſet up,</hi> ſo great a Power of Miracles, as were wrought in the Days of Chriſt, and of the <hi>Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:135384:38"/> was ſo ſhewn; both in regard of that <hi>Kingdom of Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> that did then actually ſhow it ſelf; and which indeed can never ſuffer a Total, ſo much, as Interruption, much leſs an <hi>End;</hi> But yet an Apoſtaſy from it, even a <hi>General Apoſtaſy,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> of a Generation, the <hi>Antichriſtian Generation,</hi> expreſs'd by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. by <gap reason="foreign">

And by the ſame degrees, the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> wrought in order to that, and to bring it forth, by the very ſame, the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt</hi> withdrew; and Retired in the Spiritual Vertue, and Power of it, and alſo in the Miraculous Power that comes along with it.</p>
               <p>This ſtop to its preſent glorious Appearance is very Forcibly Expreſs'd by <hi>Daniel</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 24. <hi>The Sealing Viſion, and Prophecy</hi> at the very Time of making <hi>an End of Sin, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Tranſgreſſion;</hi> ſhewing, that whereas the <hi>Glory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> was in ſtrict Juſtice due to Chriſt at the very Time of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered, and <hi>Reconciliation made,</hi> and the great Aſſurance God gave of his Acceptance of it by the <hi>Riſing</hi> of our Lord from the Dead for our <hi>Juſtification;</hi> which was in <hi>Daniels Phraſe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs;</hi> That then immediately ſollows the <hi>Sealing Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> viz. <hi>The Viſion, and Prophecy of the Glorious Temple, and Kingdom of Chriſt, even to</hi> Ezekiel 40. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Indeed there was a Gradual Unſealing that firſt <hi>Sealing</hi> in the <hi>Opening the Seven firſt Seals,</hi> which produc'd the Appearance of <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt in the Christian Empire of Conſtantine,</hi> and his Succeſſors; but becauſe under it the <hi>Antichriſtian State of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> made up every day nearer and nearer to <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s, (2 Theſ. 2.) <hi>own Time,</hi> wherein he was to be <hi>Revealed;</hi> therefore there was a <hi>ſecond ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And when there was a Challenge of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 10. by the <hi>Roar of the Lyon,</hi> and <hi>Seven Thunders uttering their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> there was yet (which ſhall be the laſt) a <hi>ſealing up the Voices of the Thunders;</hi> So that there coald not be the <hi>mighty Works of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I have thus far now ſhewn the <hi>cloſe connexion of Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> all along from the Promiſe of the <hi>Seed of the Woman breakiag the Head of the Serpent</hi> unto the very <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> appearing in far Greater Glory, than ever yet it hath done; and no Time excepted, but the Time of <hi>Straits,</hi> from the <hi>Reſtoring Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and the Time of the 1260 Days of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy,</hi> not expiring at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor yet expired.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Direct Proof of the Power of Miracles Returning, by the following Arguments for it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Now Addreſs my ſelf to the Immediate proof, <hi>That Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not ſo Ceas'd, notwithſtanding an Interruption of</hi> 1260 <hi>years, but that they ſhall yet Return, when the Succeſſion of the</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, <hi>and the ſervice of that Kingdom ſhall Require it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The general Argument I give for it, is this, That Miracles have not perfected the End, and Intention of God in that, whereunto they are appointed; Now all the Works of God are Perfect, and ſhall attain their End; If then they have not done it, it is certain, they muſt return to do it; For God cannot be Diſappointed, or Fruſtrated, in what he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>There are two great Ends of Miracles, which have not yet been Anſwered by them, which are Aſſurances to us, Miracles ſhall, and muſt Return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partic.</hi> 1. Miracles are Appointed by God to Attend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in its motion to the <hi>Ends of the Earth,</hi> as the Goſpel is the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135384:40"/> 
                  <hi>Rod of Chriſt's Strength,</hi> by which he is to Rule ſo Extenſively to the <hi>Ends of the Earth;</hi> That hath not yet been Done; Therefore Miracles muſt Return to do it, as I ſhall now Argue. Firſt, I ſay, the Goſpel was, and is to prevail to the very <hi>Ends of the Earth.</hi> This we ſee is not yet done; The Goſpel is to Eſtabliſh <hi>the Glory of Chriſt, the Glory of his Sacrifice, of his Righteouſneſs, of his Interceſſion, the Greatneſs of his Kingdom;</hi> Theſe Things, we know, how Imperfect they are as yet, both in the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their <hi>Knowledg,</hi> in the Extenſiveneſs of them, and in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Communication of the Goſpel to all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any one will ſay, why may not a <hi>mighty Pouring out of the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> together with <hi>greater Light,</hi> and more <hi>Abundant Evidences of the Goſpel,</hi> and of the Truths of it ſerve in the place of Miracles; ſeeing it is an Affirmation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt General, God works no <hi>Miracles,</hi> except upon Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, It is True, If it pleaſed God; It might be ſo, but then ſo It might have been in the Days of Chriſt, and of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> Do we not certainly know, that the <hi>Power of Chriſt,</hi> could in the <hi>Days of his Fleſh,</hi> and by the <hi>Preaching of his Servants,</hi> with the <hi>Preſence of his Spirit,</hi> have done all He, and they Did, <hi>without Miracles;</hi> and <hi>wrought yet even to the utmoſt Effect?</hi> If he had not pleaſed and thought fit to make <hi>Miracles</hi> the <hi>Convoy,</hi> and, as it were, the <hi>Triumphant Chariot,</hi> in which That Power ſhould Ride: For when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God bare them Witneſs with Signs, and Wonders,</hi> and <hi>Divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit:</hi> He yet adds, <hi>According to his own Will:</hi> He ſaw no ſuch <hi>Neceſſity of Miracles,</hi> but all was <hi>according to his own Will,</hi> his own pleaſure.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certain, If he had not Freely choſen to Work by Miracles, his Spirit would have immediately Reach'd any Heart without them; we find it did ſo. If Chriſt ſpake to any Perſon; <hi>In the very moment, he Roſe up immediately and Followed him;</hi> As Matt. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. <hi>He ſaw Matthew ſitting at the Receipt of Cuſtom, and he ſaith unto him, Follow me; and Immediately, he made no more words of it, but Roſe up, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollowed Him, He Conferr'd not with Fleſh and Blood.</hi> He was in a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> that required much <hi>Intention;</hi> He was in the Very Buſineſs of it, and warm, as we ſay in it; and it was in ſuch a Kind of Profeſſion, as Men do not uſe eaſily to be call'd off from, to mind Things of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Concernment; For <hi>Publicans and Sinners often in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Joyn'd together,</hi> were Men of no Tender, or Scrupulous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135384:41"/> Yet when Chriſt Commanded, and no <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought, he was <hi>Obeyed;</hi> If a Man among us were waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his main Buſineſs, his way of Gain and Profit; and one ſhould come to him without ſuch a Power, as the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt Acts</hi> by, and ſay to him; ſuppoſe on any <hi>Goſpel Account,</hi> when the Man was a Stranger to it; Leave that you are wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, tho it be your <hi>Office,</hi> and your <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and attend the Goſpel of Chriſt; what a Scorn would ſuch a one make of ſuch a <hi>Propoſal;</hi> But the <hi>Power of Chriſt</hi> can, where he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>Touch a Heart, Bow a Heart</hi> without the outward <hi>conveyance</hi> of a <hi>Miracle;</hi> But even a Miracle, tho It may Amuſe, and Startle, yet if the Power of Chriſt come not along with it, it could not do more, than amuſe, and poſſibly move for a while.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Zaccheus</hi> it was the very like Caſe. To <hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Chriſt firſt gave his Commands and his Promiſe, <hi>to make them Fiſhers of Men, and they left their Nets, and Follewed him, without any Miracle at firſt, becauſe his Spirit wrought Effectually in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then on the other ſide, as I have ſhew'd abundantly; Miracles did not prevail, when the <hi>Spirit came not;</hi> For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaw the Miracles of Chriſt, and yet Believed not?</p>
               <p>Indeed in the Converſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſaw fit, for the great purpoſes, for the Honour, and for the Manifeſtation of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> of the <hi>New Creation,</hi> there ſhould be a Miraculous Appearance; A Light therefore ſhone round, and other Manifeſtations of the Powerful Viſible Preſence of Chriſt, were given at it.</p>
               <p>All this ſhews then another great Reaſon, why God is pleas'd to make Miracles the Conveyance, (as I have ſaid) the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot of his Mighty Spirit; and what End, but that <hi>God</hi> would give Teſtimony, <hi>That a New Creation, a New Heaven, a New State of Things, a World to come ſhall be, when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall attain its Glory;</hi> Then ſhall be a Viſible Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Inward Spiritual Glory; The Caſe, and outſide to the Inward Glory ſhall be the outward Glory, the outward Glorious State of all Things; ſome Parcels and Portions of which are <hi>according to the Word of God</hi> ſhewn with the Goſpel, at ſuch Times, and in ſuch Caſes, on ſuch occaſions as the Lord ſees meet.</p>
               <p>For this is Demonſtration, If without Miracles Chriſt drew Souls, when he pleaſed, even whole Cities (as that of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.) without any Miracles we Read of; And if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135384:41"/> Miracles, he left many to the Blindneſs, and Hardneſs of their Heart: It is then Evident; There is no neceſſity of Miracles, but the Spirit powr'd out from on High is Enough, and only Enough with Miracles, or without, for Converſion; It follows then, Miracles are wrought chiefly becauſe God would give Pledges, and, as I ſaid, Parts, and Peices of the <hi>World to come</hi> before hand; that ſhall be a Viſible Glory over and upon the Spiritual Inviſible Glory of the Goſpel at its Height and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; Tho it may Collatterally ſerve for Confirmation, and a Teſtimony to it now.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill Miracles duly attend the Goſpel in the World, in the Days of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles; in All its Grander Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in the World; as is allowed, and agreed on all ſides; I Argue then, ſeeing the Goſpel is yet in a very Imperfect State of Acquiſt, or of getting the whole World into its poſſeſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ever the Goſpel is to come out again in that Glory, and Power, as to bring the uttermoſt Ends under it; Then even in Courſe there muſt be, there ſhall be a return of Miracles: Tho as I ſhall Argue much more, becauſe the Goſpel ſhall then Introduce the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and the World to come, It muſt be attended by Miracle.</p>
               <p>But to Argue firſt, according to the Allowances of Men with whom we now deal, let us look on the ſecond <hi>Pſalm v.</hi> 7. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will declare the Decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me; Thou art my Son, This Day have I begotten thee; Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathens for thy Inheritance, and the uttermoſt ends of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> This ſhall indeed be done by Angry Power, by a <hi>Rod of Iron,</hi> where the Goſpel does not prevail; but yet it is to be done alſo, and principally too by the Goſpel: For <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>When the Lord ſhall ſend the Rod of Chriſts ſtrength out of Zion, That he ſhall Rule in the midſt of his Enemies, and, even as other</hi> Scriptures ſay, <hi>to the very Ends of the Earth; His People ſhall be willing in the Day of his Power</hi> and through the Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace, he ſhall, as in regard of Abundance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>have the Dew of his Youth, the Children of his Youth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> at that Time, <hi>Like the Eagles, as numerous as the Drops of Dew from the dawn of the Morning.</hi> His People perſwaded by the Goſpel, ſhall come in, as <hi>Free-will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Offerings</hi> in ſo great numbers: When this Day of Chriſt's Power therefore ſhall be, and the Effects of the Goſpel Preaching ſo mighty, then according to all Rules of Proportion Miracles ſhall return to attend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:135384:42"/>
               <p> But I Argue further from poſitive, and Expreſs Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Contradiction (and indeed, I do not find many, that are ſo unreaſonable, as to diſagree, however, they may think, that Miracles ſhall not Return) that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> muſt have yet a greater Publication <hi>to the ends of the Earth, than it yet hath had;</hi> For we know, what vaſt parts of the Earth there are now, that are without the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> not only without the Belief of it, but without the very Sound of it; or at leaſt a Sound, that is at all Conſiderable, if any at All; Yet few think it ſhall be ſo to the <hi>very End;</hi> Few think God hath done, what he intends to do; that God hath gone over the World with the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as far as he hath any purpoſe to go; and that he intends to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But whoever may think ſo, Chriſt Diſcourſing concerning <hi>the End,</hi> hath told us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 6, 14. <hi>There ſhall be Wars, and Rumors of Wars,</hi> but yet we muſt not be <hi>ſo ſhaken in Mind,</hi> as to think, therefore, <hi>The End muſt needs be;</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>The End is not yet; It is True,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have been Prophecyed of as the Prince of Peace; and that under my Government Wars ſhould be made to Ceaſe to the Ends of the Earth; that the Nations ſhould learn War no more; but beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning hooks, That I ſhould Break the Bow, and Cut the Spear, and Arrows Aſunder, and Burn the Chariots in the Fire;</hi> And therefore when ever you have <hi>Wars, and Rumors of Wars,</hi> you may think that it muſt needs be, I muſt <hi>Come,</hi> and put an End to all Things, as in this State of the World, that I may put an End to <hi>Wars;</hi> But ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Theſe things muſt be, yet the End ſhall not, as yet, be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore I freely profeſs though we ſee the World at this Day, almoſt All in a Combuſtion, in a Flame; Every one knows what an Univerſal State of <hi>War</hi> there is at this Time; yet I ſhould not look on this as an Argument of the near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> if there were not more Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arguments from the <hi>Scripture Line of Time;</hi> For Chriſt hath told us that there ſhall be ſuch Things all along, and we may ſee by the Hiſtory of All Nations; There have <hi>been Wars,</hi> and <hi>Rumors of Wars</hi> all along; and yet this is no Argument, <hi>The End ſhall yet be;</hi> But v. 14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, what ſhall be an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Argument, <hi>The End ſhall be;</hi> that is, <hi>The End of this State of the World; For,</hi> ſaith he, v. 14. <hi>This Goſpel, This very Goſpel of the Kingdom</hi> (it is very Remarkable, <hi>It is the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ)</hi> It ſhall be <hi>Preached in all the World for a Witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                  <hi>all Nations, and then ſhall the End Come;</hi> Surely there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Expreſs, and Full to the purpoſe; That there muſt be juſt upon the <hi>End, a Preaching of the Goſpel in all the World;</hi> Take what <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel you will,</hi> that hath been before, if the <hi>End</hi> hath not Followed upon it; That is not the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> on which the <hi>End</hi> Follows, that is here ſpoken of; This muſt needs be granted; For when Chriſt ſays, ſuch things ſhall <hi>Be,</hi> but the <hi>End ſhall not be yet:</hi> This <hi>Preaching ſhall be, and the End ſhall be;</hi> Nothing can be more Full, that it is the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel at the End,</hi> and no other, that Chriſt ſpeaks of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The End muſt immediaiely Follow that Preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any one ſhould ſay, By the <hi>End,</hi> is not meant the <hi>End</hi> of this State of the World, but the <hi>End of the Jewiſh State;</hi> I Argue further, If it be the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> and be juſt before the <hi>End;</hi> It muſt bring in the Glory of <hi>Christs Kingdom,</hi> at that <hi>End,</hi> or elſe <hi>the End comes,</hi> and yet the Goſpel hath not done its work, and attain'd its End; Why is it then call'd the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> If it brings in an <hi>End,</hi> and yet does not bring in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Now we know the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was not brought in by the <hi>Jewiſh Deſolations;</hi> For beſides, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be a Glorious part of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom,</hi> as all Scripture Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; The <hi>Roman Pagan Monarchy</hi> kept out the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> for near 300 years after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Papal Roman Monarchy</hi> hath (except a ſhort Symbol of it in the <hi>Chriſtian Empire)</hi> kept it out ever ſince; ſeeing therefore the <hi>Kingdom</hi> has not come, The <hi>End</hi> has not come; and if the <hi>End</hi> be not come, that <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel, Chriſt</hi> intended, has not yet been: I Argue laſt of all; the Goſpel had not been Preached in <hi>All the World,</hi> before the <hi>Deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> nor ſo far, as it hath been ſince; Nor was any Thing, but the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> the proper Thing to be <hi>Witneſſed to all Nations;</hi> the concernment being ſmall to ſeveral Nations in the <hi>Deſtruction of the Jews,</hi> eſpecially if compar'd with the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of; or with the <hi>End of this World,</hi> that is juſt before that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> By all which it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there is yet the <hi>greateſt Preaching of the Goſpel to come, that ever yet hath been;</hi> why then ſhould Miracles be Divided from it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all acknowledg they are ſo proper to it? And why, ſeeing it is the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> are ſo together, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I do indeed Act by a Miraculous Power, no doubt, the Kingdom of God in a gracious Offer of it is come upon you?</hi> And how ſeeing the <hi>End,</hi> and the State after it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135384:43"/> on a Miraculous Power to bring them in, can Miracles be divided from Them!</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Scripture</hi> I Argue upon, is <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. After <hi>Chriſt</hi> had Riſen; After the Apoſtles Preaching ſome Numbers of years; ſome reckon 70 years, ſome more before the <hi>Revelation</hi> was given; all which time the Goſpel was Running, and (if at any time yet) <hi>Flying through the World;</hi> yet it is ſaid, <hi>After that, I ſaw another Angel Fly through the midſt of Heaven, having the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel to Preach to them that Dwell on the Earth, and to every Nation, Kindred, Tongue and People; ſaying with a loud Voice, Fear God, and give Glory to him; For the Hour of his Judgment is come;</hi> I deſire you would weigh this; ſaith our Lord; <hi>The Goſpel muſt be Preached to All Nations, and then the End ſhall be;</hi> ſaith <hi>John, I ſaw an Angel having the Goſpel to Preach, and to ſay, the Hour of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come;</hi> therefore no Preaching of the Goſpel <hi>but at the Hour of his Judgment is the Preaching here ſpoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I appeal therefore; if there Remain ſuch a Preaching of the Goſpel, as never has been yet, ſo Great, ſo Mighty, ſo Univerſal, that ſhould come to <hi>every Nation, Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;</hi> whether then ought not to be upon All <hi>Christians</hi> an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Return of Miracles? I appeal to the Reaſon of All Men; and moſt particularly to the Searchers of theſe Things; For tho it may look like a ſingular Opinion, that Miracles ſhould return again; yet it is no ſingular Opinion, that Miracles ſhould return again; yet it is no ſingular Opinion, That the great End of Miracles is to go along with the Preaching of the Goſpel; and to be a <hi>Testimony</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to it; This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Conſented in; If therefore there remains ſo great and univerſal a Preaching of the Goſpel, certainly Miracles ſhall return to wait upon it.</p>
               <p>And how nearly this is Conjoyn'd with that <hi>World to come,</hi> whereof we ſpeak, is Evident; In that it is call'd the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> even as the <hi>Reſtitution of All Things</hi> is that, which hath <hi>been ſpoken of by the Mouth of all the Prophets, ſince the World began,</hi> Acts 3. 18. <hi>&amp;c. And as the Finiſhing of the Myſtery of God is ſaid,</hi> Rev. 10. 6. to be that, which he had <hi>Evangeliz'd</hi> or <hi>Preached</hi> as <hi>Goſpel, before,</hi> or of old, by his <hi>Servants the Prophets;</hi> So the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Goſpel</hi> muſt needs be that which hath been always Preaching, and Declaring; It muſt be therefore the Preaching of that <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> of that <hi>Myſtery always Preached as Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again it is ſaid; <hi>The Hour of his Judgment,</hi> that is, of his Government, or of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> is come; For his <hi>Kingdom</hi> is both <hi>Judgment</hi> in a ſtrict ſenſe, or the Univerſal Government
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135384:43"/> of Chriſt; So that it muſt be, as Chriſt call'd it in the forenam'd <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>The Goſpel of the Kingdom.</hi> Thus it is every way prov'd, there muſt be a Return of Miracles; both in Regard, the Intention of God in Miracles is not accompliſhed in the Univerſal Preaching of the Goſpel; or in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> brought in by the Preaching of the Goſpel; of which <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and for the <hi>Bringing in</hi> of which <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>World to come,</hi> Miracles are ſo cloſely joyn'd with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Particular</hi> 2. But I come to a ſecond Particular, to ſhew Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles muſt Return; becauſe the great End of Miracles in <hi>Bringing in the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Reſtitution of All Things, the World to come, the New Heaven, the New Earth,</hi> is not yet Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and Perfected; ſeeing, as I have, I hope, fully made out; All Miracles are but Parts, Portions, Parcels of that <hi>New Creation,</hi> Speciminous Appearances of that great Power on the Throne, that ſaid, <hi>Behold I Create All New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that Chriſt is to have ſuch an Univerſal <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and in a <hi>Reſtitution of All Things,</hi> is ſo Evident, that they, who would deny it, are Forc'd to Fly to a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> and to a <hi>Providential Kingdom;</hi> In the <hi>Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> they think all Things may be ſaid to be now <hi>Reſtor'd</hi> and <hi>made New;</hi> In the <hi>Providential Kingdom,</hi> They think, <hi>All Things Subdued under him,</hi> and whatever is beyond Theſe, they Conſign over to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Now it is moſt True, All theſe Kingdoms are to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd; and I do Acknowledg them with all my Heart; and I do confeſs, It would be prejudice enough againſt any Doctrine that ſhould deny, that Chriſt hath now <hi>a Spiritual Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Providential Kingdom;</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom in Eternity,</hi> he ſhall moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly have.</p>
               <p>But yet that he hath diſtinct from theſe, <hi>a Kingdom of Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> of <hi>Reſtitution, of Judgment, putting All Things under him; a Kingdom</hi> of <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>New Earth;</hi> and before the State of Eternity; I will endeavour to make out; and that this being not yet accompliſhed, There cannot be yet ſuch a Ceſſation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but that they muſt Return to ſerve ſo great an End.</p>

I am ſure, <hi>If All Things were not put under him then; They are not put under him Now;</hi> For there was a far greater Appearance of <hi>All things put under him at that Time, Than of All things being put under him at this Time;</hi> even in regard of his <hi>Providential Kingdom,</hi> and much more in regard of his <hi>Spiritual Kingdom;</hi> and that his <hi>Kingdom in Eternity</hi> is not the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> wherein <hi>All things ſhall be put under him</hi> is moſt Evident; For when <hi>All Things</hi> are <hi>put under him, even the laſt Enemy Death; then he delivers up the Kingdom to God and the Father, that God may be all in all;</hi> which ſurely, If we can have any Apprehenſions of the <hi>Eternal Kingdom</hi> muſt needs be that <hi>Kingdom of Eternity;</hi> Before the <hi>Kingdom of Eternity,</hi> therefore <hi>All Things muſt be put under him.</hi> And ſeeing the <hi>laſt Enemy,</hi> that is to be <hi>Subdued is Death;</hi> The Spirit of God hath given us the exact Time of the <hi>Subduing the Laſt, even Death;</hi> And it is not till after the <hi>Thouſand years</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of the firſt Reſurrection;</hi> For then the <hi>Devil, All the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are caſt into the <hi>Lake;</hi> ſo that, as it is ſo far <hi>Subdued</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Thouſand years,</hi> as that the <hi>Dead Saints are rais'd, the Living Saints Chang'd;</hi> So at the <hi>End of the Thouſand years</hi> it is utterly <hi>Aboliſh'd,</hi> and can never again make the leaſt appearance or poſſibility of Entrance any more for ever; upon any of the Saints, who are ſecur'd in an Eternity of Life; ſo it remains ſhut up with its own <hi>Dead</hi> for ever; And this is that <hi>Second Death</hi> oppos'd to the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection.</hi> Rev. 20. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture I Rely upon for the Proof, that the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> wherein All things ſhall be <hi>brought under him</hi> is not yet ſo Accompliſhed; as that All Things ſhould be indeed under him, till the <hi>Time Appointed by the Father;</hi> is that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 13. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſts ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down on the Right Hand of God, ſays, <hi>He ſits expecting, till his Enemies be made his Footſtool; Expecting;</hi> Now, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, what we ſee fulfill'd, and accompliſhed, why do
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135384:44"/> 
                  <hi>we yet hope for,</hi> there is no more work for <hi>Hope;</hi> If the thing be ſeen, and Fullfilled; ſo to what End is <hi>Expectation</hi> of a Thing already come to paſs; why ſhould any one ſit expecting, for what he hath already in Hand: It is, as if a Man ſhould ſay, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is up, and hath Fill'd the Air with Light, and ſpread his Beams upon the whole Earth; I am waiting to ſee when the <hi>Sun</hi> will Riſe: You know that Man would be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fool, or a Madman of any one, that ſhould hear him ſay, when the Sun is in his Eye, and its Rays ſpread on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about him; I am waiting to ſee, when the Sun will Riſe; ſo if Chriſt ſhould <hi>ſit in Heaven Expecting, that his Enemies ſhould be made his Footstool,</hi> and they are already his <hi>Footſtool,</hi> would it not be to impute the greateſt Folly to Chriſt? Seeing therefore in this ordinary way of Gods Government of the World, The <hi>Enemies</hi> of Chriſt are no more probable <hi>to be made his Footſtool,</hi> than they have been theſe ſo many Hundred Years now paſt; There muſt be Miraculous Appearances of God for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great thing to paſs, and therefore they cannot be ceaſed ſo, as not to return; For All the Scripture Witneſſes, God will do this great Thing with great Wonders of Power; <hi>He will be rais'd up out of his Holy Habitation, when his Enemies ſhall fall before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we find in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the very beginning of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> or for the making way to its Succeſſion; there muſt be a Raiſing thoſe Witneſſes from the Death, under which they had long lain, and under which they continue to Lye, <hi>Till a Spirit from God enter into them,</hi> like a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which we all acknowledg Miracle; even as the <hi>Aſcenſion to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Cloud Following upon it;</hi> there muſt be <hi>a</hi> Dreadful <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> a <hi>Myſtical Earthquake,</hi> wherein the Powers of Nature have nothing to do; and ſo it muſt muſt be immediately from the Power of Chriſt; wherein that <hi>Gabaliſtick</hi> (as I may call it) or Figurative <hi>Tenth</hi> of the great City Falls; that is; all the <hi>Kings, that now give their power to the Beaſt,</hi> (which <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſo often gives by the Number of the <hi>Toes of the Feet of the Image,</hi> the <hi>Feet of Iron,</hi> and of <hi>Clay;)</hi> Theſe Ten ſhall Fall off from the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that <hi>Roman Woman</hi> they call, <hi>Holy Church ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For there the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is giving an account of the ſame Things, as in this Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4 Thoſe Divers <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit;</hi> ſo ſays the Apoſtle out of <hi>Joel, And it ſhall come to paſs in thoſe days, I will powre out my Spirit on All Fleſh, and your Sons and Daughters ſhall Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. before that Emphatical, <hi>that Illuſtrious day of the Lord come.</hi> Indeed the Apoſtle does ſay, <hi>This is that was ſpoken of;</hi> It began then; God gave a very bright ſhow of it then; It looked out upon the World with a great Glory at that Time; But an Eclipſe came upon it; it is yet notwithſtanding due to that <hi>great and Notable Day of the Lord,</hi> that Day, which he calls by a word that ſignifies <hi>Illustrious, Apparent, Glorious;</hi> and ſo, as we Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, <hi>Notable Day;</hi> How <hi>Notable,</hi> and ſo <hi>Illustrious,</hi> but by many Wonderful Magnifyings of Divine Power upon it in ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a way; So indeed none can deny, that Miraculous Powers muſt needs introduce <hi>that Day of Judgment</hi> according to the general Notion, or Doctrine of it.</p>
               <p>But ſaith the Apoſtle further, <hi>Before that Notable and Illustrious Day of the Lord Come;</hi> Now to have ſpoken this only of that Thing, that was ſeventeen Hundred years ago already, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near it; and we don't know, how many more it may be, if we have not a True Judgment upon Time by the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Line of Time,</hi> and the Expoſition of the <hi>Sure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:135384:45"/> concerning the nearneſs of that Day, we don't know how much longer, how many years more it may be to it; and yet to call this pouring out of the <hi>Spirit, before it,</hi> that was ſo long ago, as if it were but juſt before it; ſeeing God ſpeaks to us, as to Creatures <hi>of</hi> Time; is a very unexpected way of ſpeaking <hi>in any,</hi> and not eaſy to be Allowed to be the way of the Divine Spirits ſpeaking; <hi>conſidering</hi> how often Scripture ſpeaks of Great Things juſt upon that day, and not ſo long before it.</p>
               <p>This indeed ſeems ſo unreaſonable to very ſagacious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that they cannot acquieſce to, before that <hi>Day,</hi> ſo long before it; and therefore have found this way to ſalve it; to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this <hi>Notable Day</hi> of the <hi>Deſtruction of Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the day of the <hi>Vengeance of God</hi> upon the State of the <hi>Jews;</hi> I do not deny, but that is made every where a Type of the <hi>very Day of Judgment;</hi> But that Day of Deſolation, however on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts very great, is not yet great enough to Anſwer as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo great a Thing as before that Day only; nor will it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to the things ſpoken of in the <hi>Prophet Joel,</hi> nor to the great Things every where ſpoken of in Scripture, as coming near that day.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore in juſt Reaſon be underſtood only of that <hi>Day of the Judgment of God</hi> upon that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple;</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at all of it, but as of a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>that Day;</hi> and yet if be not ſo underſtood, except another <hi>powring out of the Spirit be understood</hi> before that day as near; we make a wide breach, and Gap of Inconſequence in the Apoſtles Diſcourſe; and yet ſtill the general Opinion even of Chriſtians, and their uſual way of Diſcourſe, makes that <hi>Notable Day of the Lord no nearer, than it was a Thouſand and more years ago;</hi> So far are we from what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Requires, <hi>of haſtning on to that Day of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. I Argue from the great Truths, that are yet to be Preached <hi>in Declaration of, and order to this Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> For Miracles are to give Teſtimony to Truth, when God hath great Truth to Communicate to the World, and that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to be given; As the <hi>great Things of the Goſpel</hi> had ſuch a Glory of Miracles to Seal them; even ſo the Truths, that are given proper to that Time, ſhall be Witneſſed, and Sealed with mighty Power of Miracles: The great Maſters of Diſcourſe concerning Miracles are herein Agreeing; that one great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Miracles is to recommend ſome Manifeſtations of God;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135384:46"/> that had not been before made, at leaſt, ſo far known, or ſo plainly known, or ſo <hi>convincingly known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not therefore, every One will be ready to ſay; hath <hi>not God</hi> made known all Truth already? In theſe <hi>laſt days</hi> hath he <hi>not ſpoken all Truth by his Son,</hi> and by his <hi>Apoſtles that heard him?</hi> hath he not Seal'd up, as we ſay, the <hi>Canon of his Word,</hi> the <hi>Treaſury</hi> and <hi>Standard of Truth?</hi> What Truths therefore can there be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that will need or require the preſence of Miracles to give Honour and Aſſurance to them? Is not this very thing a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Argument</hi> againſt any Further Expectation of Miracles, that there are no ſuch New Diſcoveries of Truth, to which they can be proper?</p>
               <p>I will therefore give three Inſtances of the Truth, that at leaſt, in the further more Glorious Manifeſtation of, eſpecially after <hi>the Time of the Apoſtaſy, God will grace with Miracles.</hi>
               </p>

How ſhall this Work on Men, to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135384:47"/> hear ſuch Gentiles ſaying, <hi>Shall a Man make himſelf Gods, and they are no Gods?</hi> How will this Affect all that Hear, and draw them off from their <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi> and of <hi>Gold!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or theſe words may be look'd upon, as Gods words by the Prophet; <hi>ſhall a man be ſo unreaſonable, or bruitiſh, as to make Gods to himſelf of them, that are no Gods?</hi> And ſo they are rather to be taken; but which way ever we take them; Therefore, or Becauſe of this ſo great Miſpriſion of me, ſaith God, <hi>I will this once cauſe them to know my Hand, and my might, and they ſhall know, that my Name is Jehovah;</hi> Now the <hi>Hand of God,</hi> and <hi>Might,</hi> and <hi>Power of God,</hi> are every where in Scripture, expreſſions of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; <hi>And they ſhall for this once know my might;</hi> It is an expreſſion to be paralell'd with that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Yet once more I ſhake Heaven, and Earth; So once more, the Nations ſhall know my Might;</hi> God hath oftentimes in one way, or other <hi>made the Nations know his might;</hi> eſpecially in the Days of Chriſt, he made them <hi>know his might</hi> in a ſenſe of Miraculous Power, above any time before it; but the making the <hi>Nations know for this once,</hi> is the <hi>making them know for once,</hi> that they ſhall never need to be <hi>made to know any more;</hi> That <hi>Once</hi> ſhall be ſo Efficacious a <hi>making to know.</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle hath Taught us to underſtand <hi>This Once,</hi> or <hi>yet Once:</hi> It is taking away, or removing <hi>every thing,</hi> that is to be moved <hi>out of its place</hi> by ſuch <hi>ſhaking;</hi> ſo <hi>the making the might to be known this once,</hi> is the utmoſt removing all the <hi>Pagan Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or Bruitiſhneſs of making Gods to themſelves, that are no Gods.</hi> Now ſeeing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have not yet been ſo <hi>made to know,</hi> it is manifeſt, It was not this <hi>Once,</hi> that God here ſpeaks of; For it muſt needs have produced the Effect ſo, that it never ſhould have needed to be produced any more; It muſt therefore be the laſt <hi>making known;</hi> and conſequently the Miraculous Power muſt Remain to that laſt <hi>making known;</hi> which is therefore great Proof, the Power of Miracles is not ſo ceas'd, but that it ſhall Return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Another Argument I would give for the return of Miracles, is that Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 29, 30. <hi>Lord grant unto thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that with all boldneſs, they may ſpeak thy word, and that Signs and Wonders may be done by the Name of thy Holy Child Jeſus.</hi> I deſire to know, what words of Limitation are to be found in this Prayer? or where any place of Scripture can be found, where the Servants of God are Diſcharg'd from expecting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135384:48"/> and no further? Where is it ſaid, they ſhall ceaſe here; or here, They are ceaſed, here are the Bounds? I have given Leave, They ſhall reach unto this Point, but no further? There was a Sealing up Scripture from the Day of <hi>Malachy</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> his Times; With him Scripture began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> There is a ſealing up Scripture again by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the end of his Goſpel, c. 20. 39. c. 21. 25. <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might Beleive, and if All things were written, the World could not contain them.</hi> It ſeems order'd by Peculiar Diſpoſes of Providence, that the Books of Scripture ſhould be claſp'd up with that End of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> c. 22. 18, 19. But there is no bound ſet to Miracles, or Miraculous Power; It is true it hath ceaſed, but by no Act cutting off, as I may ſay, the Entail; tho there is a ſuſpenſion; This Prayer therefore, altho it hath had a long Interruption in its effect, yet it hath no ceſſation put upon it; but It ſhall prevail unto the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> from the Promiſe of which, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. it was taken; The <hi>Hand of God,</hi> we know, is not ſhortned, that it ſhould work no more Miracles; but the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> fallen upon the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity hath brought forth this long Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; yet the Lords <hi>Hand</hi> ſhall be again <hi>ſtretched out,</hi> and ſhall not be called back, till he hath accompliſhed <hi>the thoughts of his Heart;</hi> and whatever he hath <hi>ſpoken</hi> concerning the Glory and Kingdom of Chriſt; and of that <hi>World to Come, whereof,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we ſpeak,</hi> when we ſpeak of the various <hi>Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his own will;</hi> there being ſo cloſe a Connexion between the one, and the other.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>And Firſt, The Goſpel is its own Miracle; ſo rich a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Truth, that had been Hid from <hi>Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Renovation, and change of the Whole man, and of the Action, and Converſation, by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, mortifying the corrupt Luſts, Inordinate Affections, and filling the Soul with every <hi>Grace,</hi> to <hi>Newneſs of Life and Obedience.</hi>

               <p>But it is Heedfully to be Remembred; They were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and Counterparted with thoſe open, and ſenſible Miracles, which are indeed the Miracles, that more properly we are now in Diſcourſe of; ſuch as force the Senſe, and call upon men Univerſally to ſay; <hi>Here is the Finger of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Theſe were the worthy <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt throughout that Dark Time; when no man could any ſooner look out with any of the pureſt Truths of the Goſpel, that ſtem'd that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy,</hi> but preſently <hi>Heretick, Heretick,</hi> was cryed out upon him; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I know, Many cannot underſtand, how theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> could be ſaid to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> while they lay <hi>Dead Three Days,</hi> and <hi>an Half:</hi> But I have endeavour'd, in a peculiar Diſcourſe to Aſſoyle that alſo in the <hi>Viſion of the Witneſſes;</hi> and to ſhew, that as it is ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> the firſt Martyr, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dead, he yet ſpeaketh;</hi> ſo of theſe his Succeſſors, although <hi>Kill'd, they yet Prophecy.</hi> And it is much more plain on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135384:50"/> their ſide; For their Death, however Violent-Natural alſo, yet is chiefly <hi>Myſtic;</hi> They were <hi>Kill'd,</hi> as <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> Hateful, and Curſed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> being the <hi>Sambenito,</hi> the Diſguiſe whereinto they were preſently put; but ſtill they Prophetied, tho they were ſlain: And in this Senſe alſo they continued Prophecying, becauſe, as any were Naturally Killed, others ſtill roſe up in their Room; and which is great Miracle; They were Dead, yet they could never be Buried; The People, Nations, Tongues and Languages would not ſuffer them to be Buried, becauſe their Doctrine, however Condemned before hand, was ſtill kept above-ground, as we ſpeak, in ſeveral parts of this Univerſal <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> under the Pope and his Ten Kings, the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> notwithſtanding all their Fury againſt it, their Joy in hopes they had ſuppreſſed their <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>their ſending Gifts one to another for it;</hi> yet it hath, and ſhall continue to <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> in regard of which to Come, till it comes, Their Doctrine is call'd <hi>Prophecy</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>And All this may be moſt juſtly Styled Miracle, becauſe it is not in the Train, and Connexion of Things according to the general Order, and Government of the World. For ſo when Men Dye, even all the Living World is in haſt, They be Buried, what way ſoever it be; But theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> were not ſuffered to be <hi>Buried.</hi> Their Doctrine, their Slain Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſt Remain Above to Annoy, and Nuſance the Papal and half Reform'd World.</p>
               <p>And with theſe Goſpel <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> Thoſe Goſpel Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Named, were Depoſited all this Time; the Turning and Changing Men from Sin and Sathan to God, which muſt needs be Miracle; For in the Train and Order of Things, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man will go on in his Wickedneſs and Lewdneſs, and not be purged from it, till he Dye: All the Juſtifying, Sanctifying Grace of the Goſpel, the Dying and Sleeping in, and by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, tho by Violent Deaths under the Rage of Perſecutors, was all in the Tenure, in the Conveyancings of theſe <hi>VVitneſſes.</hi> Churches are Candleſticks Fed from theſe <hi>Sons of Oyl,</hi> Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Originally from Chriſt, and his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, Spiritual, Inward Miracles, Miracles appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith, and Scripture-Reaſon, never ceas'd; For if they had, the <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom</hi> given to Chriſt, muſt have Ceaſed; And this is an Infallible Argument, there ſhall be a Return of Miracles in an outward, and Glorious Appearance, becauſe inward Miracles, to which the outward, as an externe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135384:51"/> Tranſparent Air, are Due, have never ceaſed. The outward ſhall, whenever the Reaſons of State, as I may ſay, in that <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhall Require it, appear greater, than ever yet; and this I propoſe to Univerſal Conſideration, but more eſpecially, of the Wiſe, <hi>Judg you what I ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Second Place, I will propoſe the Judiciary Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power, The Spirit of God affirms, the Witneſſes to have had, and this conſiſts of ſeveral Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Fire proceeds out of their Mouths, and Devoureth their Enemies; And if any one will Hurt them, in this manner muſt he be Killed:</hi> Rev. 11.

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:135384:51"/> 2. The Second Thing, in which the Spirit of God ſets out the judiciary Miraculous Power of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> is; <hi>They had Power to ſhut Heaven, that it ſhould not Rain in the Days of their Prophecy;</hi> Now what was this? It is taken from <hi>Elijah's</hi> ſwearing in the Name of the <hi>Living God;</hi> There ſhould be <hi>no Rain, no Dew for three years and an half;</hi> 1 Kings 17.

               <p>Now the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and indeed all Inſtruction is Compar'd to <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Dew</hi> in Scripture; <hi>My Doctrine ſhall drop, as the Rain, and Distil, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So in the Prophet, the People are Call'd to, to <hi>Break up their Fallow Ground; Till God come, and Rain Righteouſneſs upon Them.</hi> Hoſ. 10. 12.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Shutting up of Heaven</hi> therefore in the <hi>Days of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, that It ſhould not Rain,</hi> ſhews,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there ſhould be, as is very well known, was, a very Dark, and Barbarous Time, as to all Learning, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the <hi>Moons of the Apostaſy;</hi> that Chill, Fruitleſs <hi>Planets</hi> of the <hi>Night;</hi> from which the very Borrowed Beams of the Sun Fall Cold, and Languid, and without Vigor, or Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>

That there ſhould be an exceeding Drought, and Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to all Goſpel Doctrines in their Life, Purity, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And how Remarkable this was, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, I hope, Senſible; except they themſelves Love ſtill thoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Pits, and Ciſternes of <hi>Popery;</hi> or what hath the brackiſh Taſt thereof!</p>

And this will be yet clearer in the Third Particular, They have <hi>Power to turn Water into Blood,</hi> into the <hi>Blood of a Dead man;</hi> (as another Expreſſion of the <hi>Revelation</hi> gives it us) that is, that hath no Motion, Circulation, Spirits, Activity; ſhewing

               <p>But as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid, <hi>As the Lord Liveth there ſhall not be Rain, nor Dew, but at my word.</hi> So the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> may ſay, <hi>but at our word,</hi> at our Doctrine, according to the Plainneſs, Purity, Sincerity of Goſpel Preaching; <hi>If they had stood in my Counſels, They ſhould have turned Sinners from their evil ways.</hi> When men cull out the Morality of the Goſpel only, and our own Workings; as many, even of the; <hi>Styled Reformed</hi> do; little elſe; Neglecting the Holding out of Chriſt in his Blood, in the mighty Grace of his Spirit; Hence the Doctrine of the Goſpel becomes as the <hi>Blood of a Dead Man,</hi> without Power of Converſion.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, would the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> or ſhould they; ought they to <hi>ſhut Heaven,</hi> or to <hi>turn VVaters into Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, The <hi>Preaching God hath given them to Preach, the VVord,</hi> he hath <hi>given them,</hi> they muſt <hi>ſpeak,</hi> they muſt <hi>Preach;</hi> If God hath given them to declare the rare, and Seldom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, the Lowneſs, and Penury of True Goſpel Doctrine, the <hi>Heavens ſhut</hi> during the days <hi>of the Apostaſy,</hi> they muſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it; their Declaring it done is the doing it; what the Prophets Declare, They Do; as God ſays to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> I have ſet thee to <hi>Build,</hi> and to <hi>Plant,</hi> to <hi>pull down,</hi> and to <hi>Destroy; So God Set theſe Witneſſes to ſhut Heaven, to turn Waters into Bood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as Chriſt Taking to himſelf the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of a <hi>good Shepherd,</hi> condemned the Inſtruments of the <hi>Fooliſh Shepherd;</hi> and ſo turn'd all the Preaching of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> into Folly; by Preaching himſelf with <hi>Authority,</hi> and not as the <hi>Scribes;</hi> So the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhut up Heaven, and no <hi>Rain</hi> falls but at, or by <hi>their Word, and they turn waters into blood,</hi> by Preaching Plainly, and Powerfully, and Sincerely, the Truths of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And even many Souls perceive it of them, as they did of Chriſts Preaching; They find the Dullneſs and Deadneſs of other Preaching by that.</p>
               <p>Thus God hath <hi>given Power to the Witneſſes;</hi> It is given to them to <hi>turn Waters into Blood, and to ſhut Heaven;</hi> that is; to Preach ſincerely themſelves; And to ſhew other Doctrines, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous, Ruinous to the Souls of Men.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:135384:52"/>
               <p> Thus at this Day, all the Doctrines, that turn from Chriſt, and Free Grace; that is, from the Spirit, and Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; They are Diſcover'd by the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to be Deſtructive; The Sheep that come up <hi>from the waſhing,</hi> have Teeth white as Milk, waſhed with the ſincere Milk of the Word, purified from this blood between their Teeth; the <hi>Blood as of a Dead man;</hi> They hang out the Scarlet Thread of Chriſts Blood; They ſet up Chriſt, and Chriſt Alone; and ſo there is none <hi>Barren</hi> among them; They are bleſſed with doing Good to Souls; made Wiſe to Win Souls, and to turn many to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt Miraculous Power they Exerciſe is, <hi>They ſmite the Earth with all Plagues, as often as they will:</hi> That is, they may, as Freely as They Deſire, Declare the Judgments of God, even thoſe <hi>ſeven laſt Plagues,</hi> that ſhall make an end of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, and of all the Enemies of Chriſt; yea the whole Corrupted State of this Earth; and all they ſay, ſhall certainly be made good, and Fulfill'd; even as the Plagues <hi>Moſes</hi> was Commanded by God to Smite the Land, or Earth of <hi>Egypt</hi> with, and which had their full effect, are Recorded as Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Judgment; even ſo ſhall the ſmiting of <hi>Spiritual Egypt,</hi> and its Earth be found to be, when the Seal in their Forheads is Removed, and all they have ſpoken and done fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Light of that Day.</p>
               <p>But this [as often as they will] tho it ſeem altogether a word of Conceſſion, and Leaving the Matter to their Freedom, and Choice; yet it indeed gives the Faulty Reaſon on the part of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> why <hi>Popery</hi> has not been more prevail'd againſt, even throughout the whole <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy:</hi> For the Wiſe, and Holy Counſels of God do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Faultineſs of Mens Actions which bring thoſe very Counſels to paſs; as we ſee throughout Scripture in the greateſt Inſtances, as in <hi>Judas</hi> and all the Powers, that Joyn'd in Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the <hi>Son of God;</hi> They were never the leſs <hi>wicked Hands,</hi> becauſe they did what God had determined in his Counſel and Fore-knowledg ſhould be done; And while the <hi>Jews</hi> heard the Voices of the Prophets, they did notwithſtanding, moſt Evilly, Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And thus far I have ſhewn, That Miracles have not in the Inward Spiritual Part been cut off, but have run along the whole <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> tho underground and Inviſibly; But they ſhall now within ſhort Time appear in their Glory.</p>

               <p>As to the Queſtion therefore propos'd, I will give an Anſwer in Four Aſſertions how far we may in any Caſe ground Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Miraculous Power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Time of the Return of Miracles is not yet; becauſe the Days of the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time</hi> of the <hi>laſt State of the Fourth Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Roman Papal Apoſtaſy,</hi> are not yet expir'd; nor the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> yet in its <hi>Succeſſion.</hi> So that though our Time, as the Lord ſpeaks, is always ready, we have great need, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, of the Miracles of Mercy; But his <hi>Time is not always; It is not yet.</hi> If that Time be not yet, we cannot look for any Miracle in our particular caſe, with any certain Aſſurance we ſhall receive it. This is a Rule in all Caſes, not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Chriſt's Time, God's Time by ours, <hi>John 7th. v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Time of Miracles Returning may be very near, and yet no Miracles till that very Time, be wrought: <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was the immediate Forerunner of Chriſt, and yet it is expreſly recorded to us, <hi>John did no Miracle.</hi> That was no Argument the Miracles of Chriſt, and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were at a diſtance; No more is it that the Return of Miracles is far off; Becauſe we may at the preſent be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ground, or Encouragement, that any ſhould be wrought for us, as yet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Great Admonition of our Lord's, concerning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſhould be alway on our Thoughts, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 25. I ſay unto you, there were many Widows in the Time of <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet; but to none of them was <hi>Elijah</hi> ſent, but to her in <hi>Sarepta,</hi> a City of <hi>Zidon.</hi> And there were many Lepers in the days of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, but unto none of them was he ſent, but unto <hi>Naman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> This Chriſt ſpake, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Great Phyſician gave, when call'd upon; <hi>Phyſician, heal thy ſelf: Whatſoever thou haſt done any where elſe, do in thy own Countrey and City.</hi> We may not think, on any Account, to oblige this Miraculous Power of Chriſt to us, becauſe he hath pleas'd to extend it to any other; yea, though it be of a Time of Mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:135384:54"/> 3. Even in a Time of Miracles, Chriſt in doing great Things for his Servants, will not be <hi>Limited to Miracles.</hi> He expreſſed ſome Diſlike, when he ſays, John 4. 48. <hi>Except you ſee Miracles, you will not Believe;</hi> To <hi>Thomas,</hi> Deſiring ſenſible Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; He ſaid with Inſinuation of Reproof; <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſeen, thou haſt Believed; bleſſed are they, who have not ſeen, and yet have Believed:</hi> Chriſt, as I have obſerved, before, drew many Souls to himſelf without any Miracle; <hi>Epaphrodotus</hi> was not, when <hi>ſick,</hi> and <hi>Nigh to Death,</hi> Healed Miraculouſly by <hi>Paul,</hi> from whoſe <hi>Body Aprons,</hi> and <hi>Handkercheifs</hi> were carryed, and had <hi>Healing Virtue in them;</hi> and yet God had mercy on <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> and on <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in him, and <hi>Healed</hi> him; God does great and Wonderful things for his Servants, and yet without Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: This is our great Conſolation; he Works Miracles, and ſaves; He Works not Miracles, and yet ſaves; <hi>according to his own Will,</hi> he does All.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When all ordinary Means Fail, and the thing looks Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in Relation to all ſuch Ordinary means; when the <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree does not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c. yet we may <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and Glory in the God of our Salvation;</hi> even at ſuch a Time, our <hi>Feet</hi> ſhould be <hi>Like Hinds Feet, and walk on our high places; In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen;</hi> we may then come unto God; <hi>Oh thou that heareſt Prayers, unto thee ſhall all Fleſh come;</hi> And tho we cannot Find by Senſe, we have the <hi>Petitions we have asked of him;</hi> yet by Faith we <hi>may know it;</hi> and he will give us outward Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his hearing; for rather than his Servants ſhould not find him a <hi>God Hearing Prayers,</hi> he will either put the working of Second Cauſes ſo together, that ſuch putting together ſhall be next to Miracle; or rather than theſe Things ſhould not be done for them, he will ſtep out of the way of his preſent Ordinary Government of the World, and work a Miracle for them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat I may now draw this Diſcourſe of Miracles to its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I will Briefly draw up the State of the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Powers of the Holy Spirit, that were ſo Viſibly, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Acting in the Days of Chriſt, and of the <hi>Apoſtles of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that none may ſay, <hi>Lo here,</hi> and <hi>Lo there,</hi> a Power of Miracles; or this, or that is the Time of them; but that the Time of them may be known to be <hi>like the Lightning;</hi> For as the <hi>Lightning Lightneth</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>ſhineth to the Weſt;</hi> or as the very day, and the Brightneſs of it is known from all the Deceptions, and Miſtakes of the Day, when it is not; ſo ſhall the True Time of the Return of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles be known by a Compare with the Standard, and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of them in the Fore-nam'd Time; For it was a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and Exemplar above all other Times; All therefore muſt be meaſured by this; altho indeed in ſome Things, the Return of Miracles ſhall exceed, as the <hi>fullneſs</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135384:55"/> of All Times in the <hi>Second Coming of Chriſt,</hi> exceeds the fulneſs of Time, Singular only, or of that <hi>Firſt Coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the Fleſh;</hi> Yet then there was an <hi>Offer</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom to the Jews,</hi> and it ſhould have been Propagated to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but the <hi>Kingdom</hi> being refus'd, the <hi>Wonders</hi> could not be <hi>Finiſhed,</hi> nor Miracles conſequently <hi>Conſummate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The State of Miracles at the Time, I am ſpeaking of, was Illuſtrious above any Time before, or ſince it, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Miracles; various <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Gifts of the Holy Spirit,</hi> as we find in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. To one <hi>The Gift of Healing,</hi> to another of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> to another <hi>of Tonues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So one hath an Exhortation, a Pſalm, a Prophecy;</hi> yea, <hi>Then was Raiſing of the Dead.</hi> This was the <hi>First Fruits,</hi> the beginning of what <hi>was ſpoken</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Joel.</hi> Now by ſuch a Variety of Miracles, how great is the Confirmation? One or Two might be Attributed to ſome unknown Cauſe, but ſuch a Conſort, and Harmony could be only Divine; even the Atheiſt would be puzzled to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to his <hi>Occult Cauſes</hi> decently for ſuch a Variety; God ſaw in the whole Creation, where Miracles were fit to be Planted.</p>
               <p>Then Behold and look, Judg, and Diſtinguiſh of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Miracles hereby; They ſhall Return in ſuch a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as may Teſtify their Relation to that Original Exemplar-Variety in the Firſt Appearance of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in them; and that together they may make up that one (however Interrupted in regard of Viſible Miracles) <hi>pouring out of the Spirit before the great and Illuſtrious Day of the Lord,</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There were Commiſſion'd Miniſters of the <hi>Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;</hi> the <hi>Twelve Apsſtles</hi> of our Lord Jeſus; and ſome, that were as <hi>Gifted Brethren,</hi> ſharing in the Communication of theſe <hi>Miraculous Powers,</hi> as we may perceive by the <hi>Seventy</hi> ſent out by the ſame Power in ſome Regard, as the Apoſtles; and thoſe Chriſtians, to whom the Apoſtle Writes among the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>To One, To Another,</hi> ſuch Power was given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For hereby the whole Power became of greater Notoriety, of greater Authority, as in a <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> as our Lord ſays to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> accuſing him of Acting by <hi>Belzebub;</hi> By whom do your <hi>Children Caſt out Devils? Therefore they ſhall be your Judges, as in a Conneel.</hi> The Miraculous Efficacies were alſo of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Diſpoſition, and freer Diſtribution: Accordingly we may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135384:56"/> ſuppoſe; The 144000 with the <hi>Fathers Name writ on their Foreheads; who learn the New Song Firſt,</hi> and thoſe who are In ſtructed by Them in it; ſhall very Univerſally, yet according to his Wiſdom and <hi>Will,</hi> who is the Supreme Donor, be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>Power from above;</hi> as Miniſters of State in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt,</hi> and Receiving Gifts for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Miraculous Powers were Diſpens'd in a Frequency, in a Continued Daylineſs, in an univerſality; we find our Lord on all occaſions diſpens'd theſe Largeſſes of Heavenly Bounty, and Compaſſion; He never denyed any; He extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to his very Enemies, the <hi>High Prieſts Servant;</hi> onely he was (as it were) Repuls'd in his Grace, by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief of</hi> ſome; <hi>He could do no mighty Works, becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> that is, he declar'd himſelf ſo, that he might leave a Teſtimony againſt that Sin; and <hi>Warn</hi> all of it: Elſe <hi>He went about doing good;</hi> He <hi>Healed all manner of Sickneſs, and diſeaſes.</hi> And ſo by the Apoſtles, This Miraculous Power was carried throughout the ſeveral Circuits of their Miniſtry, as the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> Witneſſes concerning his own, <hi>round about from Jeruſalem to Illyricum;</hi> He <hi>Preached the Goſpel</hi> with <hi>mighty Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> and <hi>Gifts of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Rom. 15.</p>
               <p>And without doubt in the ſame manner ſhall this Miraculous Power <hi>Compaſs Sea and Land, in the Preaching the Everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Tongue, Nation and Lauguage.</hi> And till this be I would Require none to believe, Miracles are Return'd, and then indeed it will be undeniable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As there was thus a Power of Miracles given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd Officers of Chriſt; and to his <hi>Gifted Servants;</hi> So there was a Faith of both doing Miracles, and a Faith of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Benefit of thoſe Miraculous Efficacies; For as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>All Faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1. <hi>Viz.</hi> Miraculous, or Wonder working Faith; So that I could; ſaith he, <hi>remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, &amp;c</hi> ſo there is a Faith of Receiving the Benefit of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; <hi>For</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and</hi> Paul are ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. c. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To <hi>perceive a Faith to be Healed,</hi> a Faith of Receiving; And our Lord took notice of the Faith of the <hi>Centurion</hi> and others; altho it is True; In many Acts of Grace, there was no Regard we can Find to the Faith of the Receiver; but the mighty Power and Mercy of God Sallyed out upon Perſons, by the Faith of the Miniſters of the Miraculous Power; <hi>Having Mercy, becauſe he would have Mercy:</hi> And it gives us an Emblem of the Grace and Power of Chriſt in Converſion, and bringing home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135384:56"/> ſometimes, as it ſeems in a way of Preparation; ſometimes wholly without; but however it ſeems, it is certain; Divine Power and Grace Drawing near, did Erect that Faith, that is in the Wiſe Ordination neceſſary to Receive Chriſt, Grace Pardon, Juſtification, Sanctification; even as the Miraculous Power of Chriſt being abroad, and Drawing Nigh, Raiſed ſo generally a Faith in that Miraculous Power, ſo general; and the particular Dtawing Nigh of Chriſt excited it in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, on whom the Benefits were beſtowed.</p>
               <p>And thus in the Return of Miracles the Servants of Chriſt, both in Ordinary, and Extraordinary, Commiſſion'd to Work Miracles, ſhall be <hi>Cloath'd</hi> with a Faith to that End; that thoſe who can by no means Believe now, ſuch a Power ſhall Return, will by Feeling that very Power comming upon them, and the <hi>Hand-writing of the Fathers Name</hi> by the Spirit on their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> will be fully perſwaded of his <hi>wondrous works,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as near, as his Name, to <hi>Declare it;</hi> and theſe effects flowing out from it upon others, There will be a Rouſing the Senſeleſs, ſleepy World, that knows not yet the Bleſſings near it, to wait for the Graces to be beſtowed by this Power; Till theſe things are, No Opinions, or beſt Fram'd Diſcourſes, No Eſſays, Beginnings, or Scatterings of ſuch a Power can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade (I know none, would have it ſo) that Miracles are Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But when theſe are, none will be able to perſwade the contrary; and in the mean time the Hopes, Expectations, and Prayers of Chriſtians are hereby rais'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There aroſe then, and there will ariſe at the Return of Miracles, ſuch full Aſſurance, ſuch <hi>Plerophory of Perſuaſion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truth of Things, that they can be no more doubted, than the Aſſurances of the Light, and of the Day; and indeed, as <hi>Cartes</hi> Argues; Rational, Intellectual Aſſurance ſurmounts all Senſible, even ſo Spiritual Surmounts both Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and Intellectual; and this, both as to matter of Fact, that indeed ſuch things are wrought; and that they are wrought by God, by a Divine Power, and that herein is the <hi>Finger of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Herewith a mighty Stream, and Torrent of Truth paſs'd along, and Fill'd the World with the Light, and Glory of it in very wonderful manner then, and ſhall much more do ſo at the <hi>Return of Miracles;</hi> that the <hi>Iſles ſhall wait for the Law of Chriſt, his Name ſhall be great from the Riſing of the Sun, to the going down of the ſame; The Knowledg of the Lord and of his Glory ſhall Cover</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:135384:57"/> 
                  <hi>the Earth, as the VVaters do the Sea; The Light of one Day ſhall be, as the Light of Seven; For ſo hath the mouth of the Lord ſpoken: He hath ſpoken, and he will do it; He will VVork, and none ſhall let it: He the Lord will haſten it in his own Time; No one of theſe things, ſhall want it's Mate; and tho it be wonderful in our Eyes, yet ſhall it be ſo in his?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. There was a mighty Power of Converting Grace, a change of the Hearts, Tempers, purpoſe, manner of Life, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of men; as appears by the 3000 Converted at one Sermon of the Apoſtle <hi>Peters, Acts</hi> 2. a Real, and Sincere, and Sound Converſion, as the Spirit of God Implies to us; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lord <hi>Added</hi> to that Number, then of his Church, and to <hi>his Church Daily, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> The Five firſt Chapters of the <hi>Acts</hi> plainly ſhew us, what the State of Chriſtianity, and of the Churches of Chriſt was, before the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> made ſome Inroads upon it, <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>How they walk'd in ſingleneſs of heart, all Spiritual Joy and Gladneſs of Heart, in the Fear of the Lord, and had all things Common;</hi> a Heavenly Spirit and Temper prevailed in them; And ſo ſhall it be at the return of Miracles; a Spirit of Holineſs, Heavenly Mindedneſs, Love, Charity, <hi>Singleneſs of Heart,</hi> and all Purity ſhall come back with them; For theſe inward Powers of Grace, and Divine Preſence are the Life, and Spirit to Miracles; when the one returns, ſo ſhall the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; and nothing will indeed ſo convince the World of a Divine Power, and Preſence, as to find it ſelf thus Chang'd, and quite other, than as now it Criminates, and recriminates upon it ſelf; as it now perpetually complains of, Accuſes, and Condemns it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As in the Miracles of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles, there was a great Offer of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> at that Time to have Appear'd; as Chriſt ſays; <hi>Be ſure the Kingdom of God is come upon you;</hi> and Chriſt Commands the Apoſtles to Preach <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> in the Doing of Miracles, as I have fully ſhown; And it did indeed then come in the Spiritual State of it; ſo at the return of Miracles, that Kingdom ſhall indeed without any further Delay come in the Higheſt, both Spiritual Glory, and outward Manifeſtation of it; in which regard Miracles, as I have manifeſted through this Diſcourſe, ſhall be moſt Univerſal, and to the higheſt Efficacy; Becauſe <hi>the world to Come,</hi> which is the <hi>Kingdom of the Second Adam, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> ſhall be prepared for, and effectually brought in thereby; ſo that till the Time of that Kingdom be in its Succeſſion,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135384:57"/> There can be no ſuch return of Miracles, expected; and that, as I have ſhewn, cannot be, till the <hi>Four Monarchies</hi> are fully Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; For the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> and of this <hi>Monarchy</hi> cannot mingle; As therefore the Miracles proper to this <hi>Kingdom</hi> have been more Interrupted by the Courſe of thoſe <hi>Monarchies;</hi> and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the <hi>Three Times,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> of the Laſt State of the <hi>Laſt Monarchy,</hi> than at any other Time; ſo they muſt be fully end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Kingdom of Chriſt be Proclaimed, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>The Kingdoms of this World, are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt; and he hath taken to himſelf his great Power to Reign;</hi> and then ſhall Miracles, <hi>the mighty Powers of the VVorld to come,</hi> Return again to Huiſher it in; even a Stated Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Miracles, as in thr Days of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles; as our Lord ſays, <hi>I work Cures to day and to morrow,</hi> &amp;c. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, a Connexion of one Miracle with another, a Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power waited at his Hand, at his Right Hand, a ſtate of Miracles there was, that <hi>God was Magnified, who had given ſuch power to men;</hi> a ſettled Power; the Account he ſent to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt of himſelf; was, <hi>The Blind receive their Sight, the Lame walk, the Lepars are Cleanſed;</hi> and that great <hi>Spiritual Miracle</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning along; The <hi>Poor</hi> are Evangeliz'd, and under the Power of the Goſpel: <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are always joyn'd; <hi>mighty in word and deed, in doing good,</hi> Full of Compaſſion; becauſe he <hi>himſelf took our Sickneſs, and carried our Sorrows;</hi> and ſo heal'd, as in Mercy to himſelf; that it might be truly ſaid, <hi>Phyſitian, Heal thy ſelf:</hi> The Apoſtles, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State in his Kingdom, were Miniſters of Miracles, <hi>Freely Received</hi> of this Power, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Inference</hi> 1. MIracles indeed from Divine Power are able to bear the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Tryal and Examination, becauſe they give Evidence of themſelves to the whole Man; not always to the outward Senſe; For, as hath been before remarked, the <hi>Words of Chriſt</hi> are <hi>Works.</hi> Now Words of Great, and Supernatural Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are Miracles to, and before the ſenſe of Mind; but not to the Outward Senſe: So they were to the <hi>Woman of Samaria, Behold a Man</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>that hath told me All that ever I did; Is not this the Meſſiah, or the Chriſt?</hi> John 4. 29. and the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> ſaid <hi>to the Woman, We believe not for thy Words or ſaying, but we have heard him our ſelves, and know, that This is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World,</hi> v 42. And yet here was no Miraculous Appearance to the Outward Senſe; and ſo our Lord ſays, <hi>Bleſſed are They who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e believed,</hi> and yet have not ſeen. Now whatever produces Faith, is Miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mind; For it is the <hi>mighty Power of God that works in all them that believe;</hi> Even as Miracle before the Eye is ſenſible Miracle. Yet generally Miracles did commend Themſelves to both the Inward and the Outward Senſe; and ſo that their moſt obſtinate Oppoſers could not Reſiſt their Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They could bear the ſevereſt Scrutiny, ſuſtain the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Teſt and Tryal.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:135384:58"/>
               <p> When the Enemies of Chriſt, of his Doctrine and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power, at any Time ſate in Judgment on Chriſt, and his Miracles; They were Confounded and Amazed; They were forced to <hi>lay their hands upon their mouths,</hi> and to keep ſilence. This is the Excellency of the Miracles of the Goſpel; when the Juggles, and Cheats, and Tricks of the Devil, and of All Deceivers, may be eaſily found out, if they are but ſearch'd into; They muſt be ſwallowed in ſilence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Dark, or they vaniſh: What an Abundance of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Miracles have been Trac'd and Tracked, (Like their Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that they Fathally put in their <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Bible,</hi> the very ſemblance of their Miracles), to the Juggle and Cheat that lay under Them! But the Miracles of <hi>the World to come,</hi> and of the Kingdom of Chriſt, are the Greater, the more they are Eyed: They have no Enemies but <hi>Ignorance, Stupidity,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>We have an Admirable Inſtance of this, <hi>John</hi> 9. in the Cure of the <hi>Blind Man;</hi> The Neighbours had it in queſtion, and were convinced firſt; the <hi>Phariſees emptied it from Veſſel to Veſſel;</hi> They Examin'd it at all Lights; the Man being <hi>Blind</hi> himſelf, his <hi>Parents</hi> were every way ſifted, and the Matter canvaſs'd; and all they could do, was to drop the Cauſe, as they ſay, and in their own defence to Excommunicate the Perſon on whom the Miracle was wrought: They <hi>caſt him out</hi> Juridically, <hi>v</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Again, We ſhall find the <hi>Jews</hi> ſitting in Judgment upon a Miracle wrought by the Apoſtles; And what was the Great Effect of it? <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 21. <hi>The people Glorified God,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Healing that was done.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had by the power of Chriſt <hi>heal'd a man Lame from his mothers Womb,</hi> c. 3. v. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>They beholding the man which was healed, ſtanding with them, They could ſay nothing againſt it.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, They fain would have Remonſtrated unto it, but could ſay nothing againſt it; and the Reſult was, <hi>What ſhall we do with theſe men?</hi> For that indeed a <hi>Notable Miracle hath been done by them,</hi> v. 16. <hi>is manifeſt to all them that dwell in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and we cannot deny it.</hi> So that here was the Great Excellency of the Miracles of Chriſt in his Time, and in the Time of the Apoſtles: There was ſuch Evident Matter of Fact, it could not be denied by Senſe in what pertain'd to Senſe, or by the Mind in what pertain'd to Mind.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135384:59"/> to bring Souls into the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt:</hi> Miracles are only a ſenſible Declaration of the Intrinſick Excellency of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; whether They are preſent, or abſent; The Excellency of Divine Truth is ſtill the ſame; For Miracles are never a Seal to a Blank. The Writing hath the Eſſence of the matter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Seal be at every Line, or not: It is enough, It is once ſet: It needs not be ſet a new, every Time, It is Read: The Fine of Miracles once paſs'd, the Goſpel as a Deed of Uſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Senſe, and Virtue of All, and carries it, and the Fine of Miracles, as I may call it, along with it, however, but once paſs'd. Miracles are no more neceſſary continually, than One <hi>Riſing</hi> on all Occaſions from the <hi>Dead.</hi> But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellency, and Truth of the Doctrine is always the ſame: Chriſt coming, and ſpeaking Things of ſo Supreme Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that <hi>never man ſpake like him,</hi> did alſo the <hi>works,</hi> that no <hi>man elſe ever did.</hi> Hence it is alike Infer'd; <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken, they had had no Sin, but now they have no Cloak for their ſin; and if I had not done among them the VVorks, no man ever did, they had had no ſin.</hi> Converſion therefore hath been without Miracles, and with Miracles; Not therefore by the Vertue of Miracles, which of themſelves raiſe no more than Wonder, without the Spirit of God working with the Truth of the Goſpel; and that without Miracles is moſt Efficacious. Miracle can do nothing without the principal Truth; even the Divine Spirit never works by Miracles without the Divine Doctrine; It continually works by that without Miracles; many, who themſelves wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſhall yet have that dreadful Sentence upon them, <hi>I know you not, depart from me, you that work Iniquity.</hi> A man may have a <hi>Faith Removing mountains,</hi> and yet be nothing, <hi>Matt</hi> 7. 22. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135384:60"/> the Impurity of our own Spirits; The Faith that Touches Chriſt, and Draws <hi>Vertue</hi> from him, is a far more Excellent Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that which can <hi>Remove Mountains,</hi> or <hi>Heal Diſeaſes.</hi> If we had a Power of Miracles, it would indeed amaze the World, with the View, and be a kind of Nine days Wonder, But it would Flatten upon the Hearts of Men by being daily; They would grow familiar with it, and Reſiſt it, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, If the Power of <hi>Converting Grace</hi> did not go along with it; But this Inward <hi>Power</hi> is all pure, perfect Spirit, and never fails; Tho Chriſt will ſay to many, that had <hi>Caſt out Devils, and did many wonderful works in his Name; I never knew you, depart from me, you workers of Iniquity;</hi> yet to them, who have by Faith Deriv'd from him Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Victory over Sin, Vanity, Luſts, and Corruptions, over the World; that have Receiv'd Renovation, Mortification, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs</hi> of Heart: Chriſt will never Profeſs, <hi>I know you not, depart from me, you workers of Iniquity.</hi> Agreeably therefore to this, when the <hi>ſeventy Returned,</hi> and gave Account of their Succeſs, and Chriſt gave them Power to <hi>Tread on Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Scorpions,</hi> &amp;c. Yet, ſaith he, <hi>In this Rejoyce not, but Rejoyce that your Names are written in Heaven.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I begin therefore with the Conſideration of the Direct Terms, or Words of this ſo Full Propoſition of the Apoſtle:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Subject-Matter, concerning which the Apoſtle thus affirms, is not <hi>Scripture</hi> in general, but moſt particularly <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Scripture;</hi> If his Propoſition had been upon Scripture in general, it had neceſſarily included <hi>Prophecy of Scripture</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; Becauſe <hi>Prophecy</hi> is ſo excellent a part of <hi>Scripture;</hi> but it is Greater, and more Emphatical, that He particulariſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Prophecy</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Care the Apoſtle hath Taken to ſhew it is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of <hi>Scripture-Prophecy,</hi> He thus aſſerts concerning <hi>All Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi>

All Prophecy</hi> in general, and <hi>Every Prophecy</hi> in particular is the ſubject ſpoken of; and therefore a Word is choſen out by the Spirit of God, that may fully An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto in both regards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That to which the Apoſtle directs his Speech, is not with Relation to the Excellency, or Certainty, or Divine Inſpiration of <hi>Scripture Prophecy</hi> it ſelf; although that He does alſo in the former Verſe, calling it the <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy;</hi> and by way of proof in the next Verſe, of what he affirms in this: But that which He is preciſe upon in this Verſe Relates to <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture Prophecy.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. The Form of the Apoſtle's Propoſition is a flat and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Negative; <hi>Scripture-Prophecy, All Scripture-Prophecy, Every Scripture Prophecy</hi> is ſo Conſtituted, Framed, Deſcended, as not to be of <hi>Private Interpretation;</hi> and that the Negation may be the ſtronger, It is Kept, and Reſerved to be placed with the Full ſtrength of its Accent upon the Words, <hi>Is not private:</hi> The Apoſtle would not leſſen it by ſetting <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Arguments that the word <hi>Epiluſis,</hi> and not <hi>Epeluſis,</hi> was uſed by the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> are theſe two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an Univerſal Conſent, and Agreement of All Coppies in the word <hi>Epiluſis,</hi> wherein that Providence watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over All Scripture, hath particularly ſhewn it ſelf in care over this; ſo that there is no occaſion for any one to Change it, except He Himſelf were <hi>Given to Change,</hi> or would make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt againſt it, becauſe He would not own the <hi>Prophecy</hi> (at leaſt) <hi>of Scripture,</hi> to be of a Free, Open, Publick <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> nor to be Approached unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is obſerved by the Learned, The word <hi>Epeluſis</hi> is not the proper word to ſignify <hi>Illaps,</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or any thing like it; But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as it comes ſomething near the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and yet can never be it, or the ſame; ſo it ſeems ſomewhat a-kin in ſenſe to Super, or Preternatural Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but at ſo great a diſtance, It can never be Divine Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, nor like it, but moſt Contrary to it, and Abhorred of it: For it is a word of very ill Intention, and ſignifies the Force of Enchantment on the Enchanted Perſon; a ſenſe that can by no means be ſuffered to Enter into the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the Spirits of his <hi>Prophets;</hi> nor Agree to the Sacred ſcope and purpoſe of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>But I will yet further Argue againſt any other word, but <hi>Epiluſis</hi> in Arguing againſt any other ſenſe, but that ſole and ſingle ſenſe of <hi>Interpretation;</hi> ſo that by <hi>Epiluſis</hi> ſhall not, cannot be underſtood, as ſome would have it, any kind of <hi>Diſmiſſion,</hi> or <hi>ſending</hi> out the <hi>Prophets</hi> to <hi>Prophecy.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The very ſame word, differing only as a Noun and a Verb, that is uſed here by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> is uſed in the very
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135384:63"/> ſame Senſe, and in the very ſame matter, and purpoſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 34. Only what is denied here by this Apoſtle is affirmed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſe there, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Expounded</hi> his <hi>Parables</hi> but <hi>Apart</hi> or <hi>Privately</hi> to his <hi>Diſciples:</hi> There <hi>Epelue,</hi> He Expounded <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Scripture in <hi>Mark</hi> therefore is, as if the Spirit of God had on purpoſe provided an Aſſurance, in what manner theſe ſame Words are to be underſtood in <hi>Peter, viz.</hi> by the Certain, Undoubted Senſe of them in <hi>Mark:</hi> And it is the more to be Noted, if we give heed to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtic Memoir,</hi> that, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſuper-intended the <hi>Evangeliſt Mark</hi> in his Writing that <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Obſerve therefore, The ſame Divine Spirit by the very ſame Servant of his, the Penman of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor of that <hi>Goſpel,</hi> uſes both Words; the word ſo much the ſame with <hi>Epiluſis,</hi> ſo undoubtedly in the ſenſe of <hi>Expounded;</hi> and of <hi>Privately,</hi> or <hi>Apart</hi> in the Word <hi>Idios;</hi> and that they are us'd both Affirmatively, and Negatively in the ſame ſenſe; For what the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſpoke Affirmatively, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt did <hi>Expound</hi> or <hi>Interpret</hi> but <hi>Apart,</hi> that the Apoſtle in this Text lays down in the Negative, or denies concerning the ſame <hi>Expoſition</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, viz.</hi> That it is not <hi>Apart</hi> or <hi>Private.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ſo full in this kind of Argument, that it ſeems unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add; It is the word uſed by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> for the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Dreams</hi> of <hi>Pharaohs Officers</hi> by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 41. 82.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which is indeed above All, is, The Reaſon, and Scope of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, require the word, <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and no other; For the Apoſtle was not Preſſing, that the word of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is a <hi>ſure Word;</hi> That He knew, was Agreed, and moſt acknowledged between Him, and the <hi>Hebrew Strangers ſcattered Abroad,</hi> to whom He wrote, and ſo the Apoſtle takes that for a moſt confeſſed Thing, and that they <hi>gave heed to</hi> it, as ſuch; but that which required immediately to be further ſpoken to, was, That the <hi>ſure Word</hi> of <hi>Prophecy ſhines,</hi> as a <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>dark place,</hi> in which the Churches of Chriſt are, till the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt <hi>dawn,</hi> and He the <hi>Phoſphor,</hi> and <hi>Day-Star</hi> of it <hi>ſhine into the Hearts</hi> All His; For that is every where the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> it firſt <hi>dawns,</hi> and then it <hi>ſhines,</hi> and it ſhines into All Hearts, poſſeſſes All Minds; The <hi>Day</hi> of Goſpel-Light, and the <hi>Day-ſtar</hi> of that had already ſhone; for they were <hi>Eſtabliſhed in the preſent Truth;</hi> but that the Apoſtle intended,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135384:64"/> was to come; For He ſays, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil it ſhine,</hi> which could not be ptoperly ſaid of what is paſt: Beſides, That could not be come, that was yet in <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and needed <hi>Prophecy</hi> to <hi>ſhine</hi> in the place of it; which <hi>Place</hi> had been altogether <hi>Dark,</hi> if it had not been for the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Prophecy:</hi> And the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of it was, becauſe that <hi>Day</hi> did not yet <hi>Dawn,</hi> nor the <hi>Day-Star Ariſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to this <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You do well to Take Heed,</hi> you <hi>do well,</hi> as it is your Duty ſo to do; and as it is honourably well; So it is ſaid; <hi>Bleſſed is He that Readeth, and They that Hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to this, This Objection might well be made; It is a great difficulty to underſtand <hi>Prophecy;</hi> who, or how few are agreed about the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it? and eſpecially in what relates to the Time of it, and thoſe Numbers relating to Time ſo particularly in <hi>Daniel.</hi> This therefore the Apoſtle would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and ſurprize before hand, and He does it by laying this, as a firſt <hi>Principle, That All, and every Prophecy of Scripture is not of Private Interpretation;</hi> If it were ſo, it were indeed vain to <hi>Take Heed</hi> to it, as to a <hi>Light ſhining in a dark place,</hi> for then it would be as dark, as the <hi>dark place</hi> it ſelf; A <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that cannot be <hi>Interpreted,</hi> can no way enlighten the <hi>Dark</hi> State of the Non-appearance of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> But the Apoſtle aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the <hi>Sure word of Prophecy</hi> is not <hi>Private,</hi> Secret, Apart, but of an Open, Free <hi>Interpretation,</hi> is full to the Purpoſe of <hi>Taking Heed,</hi> or <hi>Giving Attendance</hi> to it, as to ſuch a <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the Apoſtles following words evince the ſame Thing; <hi>Prophecy came not of old Time by the will of Man;</hi> But <hi>Holy Men of God</hi> ſpake, as they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Carried, Moved, Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> by the Holy Spirit, as is further to be Explain'd: Now this comes as a Reaſon of what had been ſaid before, as is manifeſt by the Particle <hi>For;</hi> And it is, indeed, a great Reaſon, why no <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Sceipture</hi> ſhould be of a <hi>private Interpretation;</hi> becauſe it was given, as ſhall be ſhewn, from the <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> and not from a <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> as every Created Human Spirit is.</p>
                  <p>But if we underſtand the word us'd for <hi>Interpretation,</hi> to ſignify either <hi>Illipſe,</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> theſe following words would be only words of Amplification, and not of Proof; and to be Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the oppoſite to <hi>Private,</hi> by the Adverſative <hi>But;</hi> and not Ratiocinative as the Cauſal Conjunction <hi>For,</hi> aſſures them to be. And the ſenſe muſt run thus; No <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> is of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretation;</hi> But <hi>Holy Men</hi> of <hi>God ſpake, moved by the Holy Spirit;</hi> and if any one ſhould put in <hi>For,</hi> after <hi>Inſpiration;</hi> or <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:135384:64"/> ſuppos'd in place of <hi>Interpretation;</hi> It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, It is not of <hi>private Inſpiration,</hi> and therefore of <hi>Divine;</hi> For there can be no oppoſite to <hi>Private,</hi> but <hi>Divine</hi> in the Apoſtles ſenſe, and therefore it is not of <hi>private Inſpiration;</hi> Becauſe, or, For, <hi>Holy men</hi> were not <hi>Privately,</hi> but <hi>Divinely Inſpired;</hi> which is Amplification, and not Probation: But if we take, as on all Accounts we ought, the word to be <hi>Interpretation,</hi> the <hi>For,</hi> comes in moſt juſtly, as introducing a Great Reaſon, Why <hi>Prophecy</hi> cannot be of <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> becauſe it is of <hi>publick Inſpiration,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn; How ſtrong a Reaſon is this!</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing Probation, or Proof, makes a Diſcourſe ſtronger than Amplification only; If there be any doubt concerning a word, Whether This or That? That ought to be pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erred which makes the Sacred Text more Sinewy and ſtrong, and ſo does the word <hi>Interpretation</hi> here: And ſeeing there is ſo much for that word, and nothing againſt it, it ought to be acquieſced in by All, as offering ſo great a Truth; That we ought as in Hearing, ſo in Preaching, to give the ſenſe of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Ezra</hi> and the other <hi>Levites,</hi> and the People under them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>They gave the ſenſe of the Law,</hi> and <hi>Cauſed the People</hi> to <hi>underſtand,</hi> the <hi>Reading,</hi> or <hi>Preaching;</hi> that is, the inward ſenſe of it, and not only the Syllabical Reading loſt in <hi>Babylon;</hi> as ſome may ſuppoſe; For that is beneath the Holy Spirits notice: And thus ought <hi>Prophetical Scripture</hi> to be Adminiſtred; Becauſe it is not of <hi>private Interpretation.</hi> It, and the Time of it, ought to be opened, and explained, All and every part in all its Divine ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>But that, further yet, This point of <hi>Interpretation</hi> may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and ſecured, and not only ſo, but highly illuſtrated; I will endeavour to clear, that the Grand Importance of the Context, nay, of this whole Epiſtle, is Adjuſted and Prepared to Aſſure, That <hi>Prophecy of Scripture</hi> is not of a <hi>Private Interpretation</hi> in that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Point of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Time of it; That <hi>Myſtery of God to</hi> be <hi>Fulfilled, Evangelized</hi> by <hi>All his Prophets,</hi> that <hi>Reſtitution of All Things</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom ſpoken of by All the Prophets, ſince the World began:</hi> Now of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the Time of it, The Apoſtles Affirmation.

                     </hi> when and in what they ſpeak of it, hath the chief, and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place; And therefore the Diſcourſe upon ſo great a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo levelled, and prepared (as I may ſay) to all intents and purpoſes, for the Juſtification of ſearch into <hi>Prophecy,</hi> concerning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135384:65"/> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and what, or what <hi>manner of Time,</hi> the Spirit of God hath ſignified, is, indeed, a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Now then, the occaſion of all the Context, is the mention of the <hi>Abundant Entrance</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and That, an <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> Now of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> there is a Twofold ſtate; That which is now at preſent and by way of preparation, or the <hi>Miniſtration of an Entrance;</hi> and concerning that, The Apoſtle ſays, They <hi>were eſtabliſhed</hi> in the <hi>preſent Truth.</hi> 2. There is a Future State, and Glory of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is that <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> and to which this <hi>preſent Kingdom of Grace Miniſters</hi> an <hi>Entrance;</hi> and of this, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I will not be negligent to put you in remembrance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>Baſis</hi> or Foundation laid then, I will firſt give great Arguments, That through the whole Epiſtle, and particularly in this Context, the Apoſtle hath very great Relation to this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and moſt particularly to the Time of it. 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>I come therefore to the ſecond thing; that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> is adjuſted to, and that is, to the ſhewing the time of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> for which I give theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it the <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom;</hi> by which; as was before intimated, he refers to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Prophecy</hi> of that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Dominion, Dan.</hi> 7. 27. which is poſtpon'd to four <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Monarchies,</hi> the laſt of which was then in courſe, when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wrote this; and to the laſt ſtate of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Feet of Iron and Clay,</hi> and the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and a little one chief of the <hi>Ten,</hi> there was an allowance of <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> before the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> could come into its Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apostle</hi> by ſaying, <hi>The ſure word of prophecy ſhines as a light in a dark place,</hi> intimates, it foretels the time of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Kingdom;</hi> how could it ſhine ſo effectually, as to <hi>enlighten the dark place,</hi> if it gave no Knowledge, when <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd. For that <hi>Prophecy</hi> does not paſs immediately into effect, made the ſpace between the appearance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Fleſh</hi> and in <hi>Glory dark:</hi> and therefore the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives us a direction upon the Time, when the eflect of <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſhall be, the hope and aſſurance of which Enlightens.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> according to other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>day dawning,</hi> and the <hi>Day-Star ariſing;</hi> one ſignifying the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> the other the glory of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> So the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of God is to be fulfilled in the days of the <hi>Seventh Angel,</hi> and then Chriſt appears in his Glory. So the <hi>Apostle</hi> diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Chriſt blaſting</hi> the <hi>man of ſin</hi> with the <hi>Breath of his Mouth;</hi> which is by the mighty power of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> and then utterly conſuming and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating Him, with the <hi>Brightneſs of his Coming,</hi> or <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> that ſhould ſo long delay the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in <hi>myſtical</hi> Terms, under the <hi>ſhade</hi> of <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi> and <hi>Gnoſtiſciſm,</hi> ſo fit to type out the <hi>Idolatry,</hi> impurity of

                     <hi>Manners,</hi> and all the <hi>Abominableneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> State; of which <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> whoſe repreſentation <hi>Daniel</hi> gave, as thinking to <hi>change Times</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> until the time <hi>of the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> Now of this very <hi>changing Times</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> is the Second Chapter of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> a delineation and moſt <hi>prophetically,</hi> and at greateſt advantage after the mention of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> it is given.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His Third Chapfer moſt plainly and exprſly refers to <hi>Time;</hi> for he anſwers not as ſome think, the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> but the <hi>Antichriſtians</hi> Objection, thoſe great <hi>Burleſquers</hi> of Chriſtianity into Fables; called therefore Scoffers; who ſay, That all things from the <hi>Flood</hi> having continued as they were, there is no ſuch change as of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> to be expected; and ſo all that which concerns the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> hath paſſed with them for <hi>Millenarian Hereſie.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath therefore laid down the Rule and Standard of Time, accounting the Six-days of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, each as at a Thouſand Years; and in the Evening, or as between the two Evenings of the ſixth <hi>Millenary</hi> begins the <hi>Sabbatical Milenary,</hi> or the <hi>Seventh Thouſand;</hi> which is with the <hi>Lord;</hi> that is, with relation to the Lord, or the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in relation to his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> but as one day, often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> and that <hi>Sabbath Day;</hi> in which Saying of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> That a <hi>Thouſand Years is as one Day;</hi> there is a manifeſt foreſight of the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now as this view of this Epiſtle gives us a clear apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how full to the purpoſe of <hi>Prophetical Scripture,</hi> this Epiſtle is written, how it ſimpathizes, and is contemporate with the whole Scope and Spirit of it; ſo the Words and Senſe of <hi>Interpretation</hi> is exactly fitted to all, and no other can fit it.</p>
                  <p>For there were two things, all the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> both unbelieving, and believers, were fully agreed in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> were of <hi>Divine Inſpiratien;</hi> that <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> came not by the <hi>will of man,</hi> but was from the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> This the Believing, and Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were both moſt zealous of.</p>

                  <p>To theſe the Apoſtle therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to direct the force of his Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>But that Jeſus Chriſt was not to be owned as the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>King of Iſrael;</hi> notwithſtanding his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did not immediately appear; was a Point the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> are to this day ſcandalized at, even to their rejection of Chriſt the <hi>True Meſſiah;</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> were very tender in. Therefore that Jeſus Chriſt was the <hi>True Meſſiah,</hi> and that great Prince, the Apoſtle gave firſt the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Objection ſtill remains; That the <hi>Prophecys</hi> run all upon a <hi>Glorious Kingdom of Meſſiah</hi> at that time to appear, as the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> thought; and therefore the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, Chief-Prieſts, Elders,</hi> their whole Sanhedrim determin'd againſt him with a high hand, that he was a Deceiver. The aſſerting therefore the Divine <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> could not be to the main purpoſe; but that it is not of <hi>Private Interpretation,</hi> but that ſerious Chriſtians may find the ſenſe and meaning of it, and that it is not within the Encloſure or Embaraſſe of any San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, Council, or Infallible Breaſt; This is indeed highly to the purpoſe; and that according to the Senſe and Meaning of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> in it; one part compared with another, by the Aſſiſtances of the ſame Spirit; it would appear, that as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s Seventy Weeks brought down Time to its fulneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcention of Chriſt,</hi> that a <hi>dark place,</hi> or Interval of delay and patience, for that Kingdom muſt needs be for a long ſpace, but that yet that all Takers heed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy <hi>Prophecy</hi> leads through <hi>the dark place,</hi> with the Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Courſe of Time, and how long it ſhall be until the <hi>dawning of the day, and the ſhining of the day Star</hi> into the hearts of

                     <hi>Argument</hi> I. The Divine Spirit hath an Infinite and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſcience of things that are to come to paſs; <hi>Known to him are the Works of God from the very Foundation of the World</hi> to the end of it, with every particular Accident to the very leaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; and therefore he can foretell all things, as clearly as he pleaſes; and ſo that they may be interpreted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>He ſearcheth <hi>all things,</hi> even the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Counſels of old are faithfulneſs and truth;</hi> who calleth the End from the Beginning, and can declare it; For he worketh all things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Counſel of his own Will, which Will he <hi>knew from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> within himſelf.</p>

                  <p> Now in all theſe Particulars I uſe the Word Foreknew, or Foreſaw; to avoid any diſpute on the Word Fore-ordered, which elſe I altogether prefer.</p>
                  <p>God therefore in ſcorn to the Dark <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Devil, as well as to the Black Dens and Caves, out of which he gave them, ſays thus; <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 19. <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark place of the earth; I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye my face in vain, viz.</hi> my Counſel and Will in <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as they that ſeek to the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathen; For I the Lord ſpeak Righteouſneſs, I declare the things that are Right; Right</hi> in Regard of Infinite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Fore-knowledg of all Events; I ſpeak Things <hi>That are All plain to him that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeth, and Right to them that find Knowledg.</hi>

                  <p>It cannot be ſupoſed, that the Divine Spirit can have any neceſſity upon him to ſpeak Darkly, or Ambiguouſly concerning things to come, if he pleaſe to ſpeak at all of them; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he hath been pleaſed to ſpeak of them; or that in that Rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Things are ſo undoubtedly certain, ſo Univerſally Agreed, and Acknowledg'd, that altho they themſelves make a High Argument in this point; yet They need no Proof, but Require only to be Magnified, Diſplayed, and Illuſtrated.</p>

                  <p>Now All this I have Diſcourſed in General, I would parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Argue concerning <hi>Prophetick Time,</hi> and by an Argument moſt peculiar to it:</p>
                  <p>For not only in general, If <hi>All and Every Prophecy</hi> be Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of a not <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> then not <hi>Prophecies</hi> by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers defining Time to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> For as hath been ſaid, if <hi>All Scripture,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, be of <hi>Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> Then <hi>Prophecy;</hi> So if All <hi>Prophecy</hi> be not of <hi>Private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then not that very particular Part of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which Defines Time; And as <hi>Prophecy</hi> is ſo excellent a part of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſo the Numbers Defining Time are an excellent part of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and therefore cannot be of <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> if Prophecy be not ſo; For every General includes all, eſpecially chiefeſt Particulars.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall further Argue with a Peculiar Reſpect to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Numbers of Time,</hi> that they of any cannot be of <hi>Private Interpretation;</hi> For <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> are Things of ſo great Exactneſs, that the whole Communication of the World Depends upon them; and Scripture puts upon them great Honour alſo, requiring above all, that they be Exact;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135384:72"/> as the Rules of all Enter-Courſe; Now therefore when Scripture takes <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> of Time into it ſelf; if theſe are not well underſtood, how can they be ſuch Standards of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſe? Seeing then Prophecy hath ſo many Numbers 2300 <hi>Eves, Morns; Time, Times, Half a Time;</hi> 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now ſeeing an Inſignificancy in the Higheſt Points of Signification can by no means be imputed to the Wiſe, and <hi>Holy Spirit of Prophecy;</hi> I conclude, that even theſe <hi>Prophetick Numbers</hi> in a peculiar, and Eminent Manner, may be underſtood, both what ſpace of Time they Emenſurate, or Line out to us, and alſo when they Begin, and when they End; and ſo I have finiſhed the Firſt Head of Diſcourſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

                     <hi> Let God be True, and every Man a Lyar;</hi> Now God hath ſaid <hi>Every Prophecy of Scripture</hi> is ſo Deſcended, that it is not of <hi>Private Interpretation;</hi> that <hi>they do well,</hi> who attend to the Light of it, <hi>ſhining as in a Dark place,</hi> and ſo Enlightning it; if then it were Dark it ſelf, how ſhould it enlighten a <hi>Dark Place;</hi> for it would be Dark to Dark, which increaſes Darkneſs ſtill; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever enlightens, muſt be it ſelf Light.

                  <p>The immediate Cauſe therefore of this ſo general prejudice againſt ſearch into <hi>Prophecy,</hi> however Coloured over with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Reverence of Divine Myſteries, and ſecrets, into which Men pretend they would not Pry, are theſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. How many are they, who are afraid of the very Light it ſelf? what <hi>Prophecy</hi> Reveals, is ſo contrary to the State they are in, that they are, as the Expreſſion is in <hi>Job,</hi> upon all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch <hi>Light,</hi> as it were in the <hi>Terrors of the ſhaddow of Death;</hi> The Aſpect of <hi>Prophecy</hi> upon both the Civil and Eccleſiaſtick State of the preſent World is moſt Terrible, eſpecially, when it comes to the Determination of Time, as near: Thus the Lord makes Fooliſh the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135384:80"/> by Scripture, and Experience, that Glory hath been, and yet is under ſo long a Delay, from the Time of that <hi>Viſion</hi> given to this Day.</p>
                  <p>Now this I have all along obſerv'd, from <hi>Prophetick Viſion</hi> to <hi>Prophetick Viſion,</hi> through the <hi>Prophecy of Daniel,</hi> and of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> in thoſe Expreſs References to that, as I juſtly call it, <hi>Archetypal Viſion,</hi> from the very giving it to the End; And I Account it as a Pole-ſtar; like the <hi>Star</hi> that Led the <hi>Wiſe men to Christ;</hi> ſo this <hi>Viſion</hi> ſhapes an Unerring Courſe to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>And becauſe, one Principal Point in that <hi>Viſion</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was the <hi>Throne,</hi> Leading to the <hi>Throne of God, and of the Lamb in the New Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 4. 3. 7. <hi>and</hi> Rev. 22. 3.

                  <p>Now then firſt, I muſt premiſe, that there is not the ſame Reaſon to expect ſo particular an Illuſtration of it by any <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Event,</hi> as in ſome Caſes in the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> For the <hi>Line of Time</hi> it ſelf muſt Umpire, and Determine which ſhall be ſuch, or ſuch an <hi>Epoch,</hi> or Point of Beginning; when a Great Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Similarity of Euents gives a Likelyhood to One Point of Time, as much as to another.</p>

                  <p>But indeed in the very whole Courſe of Events, the Plumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> and comparing every part of the Line with the Event, and of the Event with the Line is the moſt Stable, and Satisfactory Aſſurance that can be Given; and in ſuch a Multiplicity of Events Frees from Diſtraction, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135384:83"/> And this hath given me <hi>Plerophory</hi> of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> as from the <hi>Bright Shining of the ſure Word of Prophecy</hi> in the midſt of ſo many Miſtakes, and ſo much Incertainty thereupon.</p>
                  <p>But altho Any ſingle Event among ſo many, and in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction one with another, ought not without the Peculiar Diſtinction of the <hi>Line of Time</hi> to ſeparate it ſelf from all the Reſt, and Claim to it ſelf the Right of Giving the <hi>Epoch;</hi> yet it was moſt Condecent to the Wiſdom of that Providence, that looks to the bringing to paſs All, that hath been declared by the <hi>ſure word of Prophecy;</hi> to take care, that there ſhould be a ſufficiency of Events to Type out the whole Chain, having a Concentring and Reſt upon that year as the Epoch of <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>Half a Time;</hi> as I ſhall very briefly preſent to View.</p>
                  <p>When then God had been pleas'd to make known by the Types of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> that ſoon after the Empire in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the <hi>Apostaſy</hi> was preparing to Enter; in that the <hi>Hundred Forty, and Four Thouſand</hi> were Sealed; that the <hi>Worſhipers</hi> were taken, as it were, in their laſt Appearance in the <hi>Outward Court,</hi> and Retired into the <hi>Inner-Temple;</hi> and the <hi>Church Flying</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> and the <hi>Trumpets</hi> in <hi>preparation to Sound.</hi> Thus All being in Readineſs, God gives <hi>Types</hi> of thoſe Four great Events, to which <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time, Three Days and an Half, Twice Forty two Months, and Twice Twelve Hundred Sixty Days</hi> as hath been often obſerved, are allowed; and which Receiv'd their <hi>Epoch</hi> here; <hi>Types</hi> I ſay; For I have not, I declare, dar'd to Rely upon them, as events Determining the <hi>Epoch,</hi> of theſe Great Times, but fair <hi>Types,</hi> and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Each.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt Event, I would obſerve, is; That, which I find moſt agreed in All <hi>Chronology;</hi> that this very year; <hi>Cyril, Biſhop of Alexandria,</hi> brought forth his <hi>Cyclus Paſchalis</hi> for ſetling the Due Time of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> Adjuſting <hi>Lunar</hi> years to <hi>Solar,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Golden Number.</hi> Now this is very Wonderful, that juſt at the Time, when the Lord, for the <hi>Interpretation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> Time ſhould, (to Allude to the <hi>Need</hi> Chriſt had of the <hi>Aſſe</hi> in the Goſpel,) have need of ſuch an Adjuſtment to be ſollemnly brought in, and Avowed in the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity Antichriſtianized;</hi> which is the <hi>Outward Court given to the Gentiles, viz.</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian Gentiles to Tread under Foot,</hi> it was ſo done: For then <hi>Forty two Months</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles Precalated</hi> to the <hi>Forty two Months of the Beaſt,</hi> This was very obſervable.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:135384:83"/> 1. Becauſe hereby Providence gave notice; that this was the very year, that by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> according to the Foundations, upon which a ſetled Time of <hi>Eaſter</hi> is Found, <hi>viz.</hi> by Conforming <hi>Lunar,</hi> and <hi>Solar Time</hi> one to another; The <hi>Moons</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Beasts Moons</hi> are together made juſt even to the 1260 <hi>Solar Years;</hi> And which is very wonderful, juſt ſo many years, as the <hi>Beaſts Moons</hi> want to make them equal to 1260 <hi>Solar years</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> according to that <hi>Golden Number;</hi> (the very Ground of any <hi>Cyclus Paſchalis;)</hi> viz. 38 years, and ſomething more; Juſt ſo many are Found between 437, (when the Paſchal Cycle was, as I ſay, firſt brought forth,) and the Ceſſation of the <hi>Chriſtian Empire;</hi> when the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Succeſſion, and ſo Time Dated from him, as the Supreme or Seventh Head, and Eighth King (for ſo it ought to be) began, <hi>viz.</hi> at 475 ending, or 476.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very obſervable, Becauſe as hath been alſo more Fully ſpoken of elſewhere, and as is very well known; The <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> hath in regard of <hi>Shrivings,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſions, Pennances, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceo, Pardons;</hi> the ſo ſuperſtitious Sollemnities of its <hi>Good Friday;</hi> the Idolatry of its <hi>High Eaſter Day</hi> Maſs; ſuch deep Intereſts in <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and the <hi>Moveable Feaſts</hi> dependent upon it.</p>
                  <p>But altho <hi>I</hi> cannot but think this very Remarkable, when I find 437, the very year Determin'd upon by the <hi>Line of Time;</hi> yet I could not dare to reſt upon it without that; For ſome Attempt the Predeceſſor of <hi>Cyril, Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> had made this way; and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>Exiguus,</hi> perfected upon what <hi>Cyril</hi> had done; But when the <hi>Line of Time</hi> concurs with ſuch a Note of <hi>Lunar</hi> Time, proper to <hi>Moons,</hi> Equated to <hi>Solar</hi> Time; It appears to me very great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Event</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or <hi>Goths</hi> this year made an Excurſion upon the People of the Empire, call'd the <hi>Arverni,</hi> with all manner of Calamities; This was a Type of the <hi>Hail mingled with Fire in the First Trumpet;</hi> yet ſo that this is not to be taken, but in Conjunction, as hath been already ſaid, with what went before, and followed after; For it could not be in one year, that the whole <hi>third part of Trees,</hi> and of <hi>Green Graſs;</hi> that is; the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories</hi> of ſo great an <hi>Empire,</hi> (of which Empire <hi>Third part</hi> is made by this <hi>Prophecy</hi> as a <hi>Hieroglyphic,)</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135384:84"/> through the whole <hi>Empire;</hi> Yet on this neither dare I rely alone; For as great Events of this Kind, and much Greater before and after There were; yet this, however a ſmall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure coming in its juſt Place after ſo great a Figure, as the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> Directing perpendicularly upon 437, as the <hi>Epoch</hi> of the <hi>Time, Times, Half Time,</hi> is very puiſſant Aſſurance of that very year.</p>

                  <p>I muſt Acknowledg, as I have alſo publickly Declared; I have been much more inclined to Hope (tho not without, as Freely, Profeſſed Fears, and Doubts for Reaſons, as openly given) that we ſhould in theſe years have ſeen much greater <hi>Works of God;</hi> becauſe I eſtimated the Pace, I thought Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would chooſe, and the ſteps, it would take, according to what hath been generally hitherto in the World.</p>

                  <p>And this is that moſt Acquieſcible and Satisfactory Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Myſterious Providence in Twiſting a <hi>Confederacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Proteſtant Nations</hi> and ſo many of the Vowed <hi>Tributaries of the Antichriſtian Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> whoſe Intereſt Lies, as

                  <p>Theſe things then being Premis'd, I have very great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Doubt, and Fear; The <hi>Proteſtant Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> under them ſhall Advance little higher, till the Period it ſelf 97; which I ground upon ſingular Remarks in that <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of <hi>Nebachadnezzars Image,</hi> Dan. 2.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I obſerve in that grand <hi>Calendar</hi> of Time for the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt;</hi> The Deſcent of Time is by the parts of the <hi>Image,</hi> and ſo by the <hi>Metals</hi> Aſſigned to the ſeveral, as I may call them Regions or Parts; the Firſt, or Beginning Point of Time is in the <hi>Gold</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> or the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire;</hi> Thence it goes down to the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and <hi>Arms of Silver the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Kingdom;</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Belly,</hi> and <hi>Thighs</hi> of <hi>Braſs, the Kingdom of Greece;</hi> and ſo comes down to the <hi>Legs of Iron,</hi> the Firſt part of the <hi>Roman Pagan Empire,</hi> and laſtly, To the <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Ten Toes, part of Iron, and part of Clay;</hi> that is, the <hi>Ten European Kingdoms,</hi> into which that <hi>Pagan Empire</hi> was Divided; when joyn'd with the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> the <hi>Clay</hi> proper to each of thoſe <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Order, and Diſtinction of the Parts, and of the <hi>Metals</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> is ſo Eſſential to the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> is ſo exact; there can be no change without great Reaſon, and even great ſignification Deſigned by that Change, and <hi>no chance in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Order of the Parts, and the Metals, is given firſt <hi>Synthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,</hi> or <hi>Conſtitutively,</hi> v. 32. 33. The <hi>Image's Head was of Fine Gold; his Breast and Arms were of Silver; His Belly and his Thighs of Braſs; his Legs of Iron; his Feet part of Iron, part of Clay;</hi> The Conjunction therefore between the <hi>Iron,</hi> and the <hi>Clay;</hi> tho they did not mix one with the other, muſt needs be very cloſe in the Conſtituting the <hi>Feet;</hi> and yet to make more clear this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and order; It is ſaid, when the <hi>Stone cut of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> came to <hi>ſmite</hi> the <hi>Image,</hi> the <hi>ſtroke</hi> was upon the <hi>Feet,</hi> that were of <hi>Iron,</hi> and of <hi>Clay.</hi> Again, v. 35. when the Method is

                  <p>Now this Conjunction, and order are ſo Eſſentially, and Subſtantially Fix'd, They can never be unfix'd any more; This muſt be the Conjunction, this muſt be the Order, and nothing that Comes after it, can Diſannual it.</p>
                  <p>And yet when it comes to the laſt <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> in the <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Dream;</hi> and ſo when the Event is ſuppos'd to come to its Complement, that the <hi>Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands</hi> Falls upon All, and <hi>Grinds them to powder.</hi> Then the <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>Clay</hi> are ſeparated by the <hi>Braſs;</hi> that has nothing to do in the <hi>Feet,</hi> but with the <hi>Belly,</hi> and the <hi>Thighes</hi> only; For they only were of <hi>Braſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the very Order given by the Spirit of God in this laſt part of the Viſion, I Find upon ſearch no Reaſon to doubt in the leaſt; there appearing no demurr on a Different Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it ſtands in the <hi>Chaldee Verity,</hi> or the <hi>Syriac Verſion,</hi> as may be ſeen in B. <hi>Walton's Polyglot Bible:</hi> And yet it is, as if the <hi>Feet of Iron</hi> were joyn'd immediately with the <hi>Thighs of Braſs,</hi> and the <hi>Clay</hi> removed out of their place; and, as if the ſtroke were on the <hi>Braſs,</hi> before it was on the <hi>Clay;</hi> whereas it was made again and again, and a third Time Certain, The ſtroke is on the Feet of <hi>Iron and Clay,</hi> before the <hi>Braſs</hi> ſhould feel the Force of it; Now all theſe are ſo great Points of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> that nothing can unſettle them without ſubverting the whole Frame: For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It muſt needs therefore be; That for the Truth of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, the Order of the Metals, and of the Parts, and the Order of the Stroke, were all given before, as they are, were and ſhall be; And that the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> preſumes, that none would think; It either on purpoſe, or Caſually, would Deſtroy its own Frame.</p>
                  <p>I offer therefore to deep ſearch of others, and the Conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And the Reaſon is this, <hi>That God might make known to the King,</hi> and in him to after Ages, <hi>what ſhould be hereafter,</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> aſſures us. Now the very utmoſt of that <hi>Hereafter</hi> is very near Come, Even, as Near, as <hi>Ninety Seven,</hi> as I have fully ſet out; By comparing therefore the ſtate of Things now with this <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> we may arrive to ſome good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Underſtanding in the Reaſon of the Change; I ſay, comparing it with the preſent State.</p>
                  <p>I look then upon the preſent ſtate of the <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy calls them,</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi> and their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> I conſider, which of them, of All others bears the <hi>Metal; Iron;</hi> at the greateſt Luſtre of Appearance at this Time; and by plain matter of Fact that is the <hi>French Power,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> Then I conſider where that, which was heretofore, call'd the <hi>Braſs</hi> in the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Four Kingdoms</hi> now Reſides; and the <hi>Braſs</hi> being the <hi>Grecian Kindom,</hi> as All <hi>Interpreters</hi> agree; The <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Empire</hi> is beyond all Conteſt, known to be in the Hands of the <hi>Turk,</hi> whoſe Port is known to be at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are then two things, God makes known to us by this Change in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> concerning that laſt State of this <hi>Image,</hi> when the <hi>Stone ſhall</hi> fall upon it.</p>

For when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power works, <hi>Nullum Tempus Occurrit Regi,</hi> Nothing can Lett Divine Power.</p>
                  <p>Altho then I moſt Sincerely, and Earneſtly Pray, that the Lord of Hoſts would Pleaſe to give Succeſs to the <hi>Arms of the Protestant Princes and States,</hi> and moſt particularly to our own; So far as may poſſibly conſiſt with his own Wiſe, and Holy Determinations; Yet I am Bold to make theſe <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> from this Light of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> I have firſt Receiv'd, and now Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd; Partly to Arm with Patience, and Submiſſion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of ſuch an Iſſue, as we Naturally Deſire; partly to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and Aſſure, as to ſome great Points at the Preſent; and Eſpecially to Aſcertain that <hi>Grand Iſſue</hi> of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the End.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135384:88"/> alought; and moved him; and not any <hi>Created VVill,</hi> but the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> alone: He ſpeaks the State and Poſture of Things, that ſhall Confine, and Border upon the Ruin, and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the Manifeſtation of <hi>the Glory of the Lord,</hi> Immediately Conſequent upon it; And this State he declares, ſhall be by the peculiar Ordination, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts;</hi> of him, who has the Government of the whole <hi>Hoſt of Heaven and Earth;</hi> ſo that nothing ſhall be able to move to the Contrary.

From hence therefore, I Argue, All kinds of Diſappointment, and Fruſtrations of All the Labour, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, Enterprizings, that are in the World; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from Princes, Councels, Governments; From Trade and Commerce at Home, and Abroad; From Armies, and Navies; From Generals and Commanders of them, and their whole Force; and this not only in one part of the World, but in the Nations, and People taken together, and in the Groſs; Such Labouring in the <hi>very Fire</hi> and <hi>wearying</hi> themſelves for <hi>very vanity,</hi> are no Argument againſt ſuch a Glory of God being near, and the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Glory covering the Earth as the Waters do the Sea.</hi> Such a Glorious Revolution, and Change of the World, being very nigh, and <hi>at the doors;</hi> ſo that they are rather an Argument for the nighneſs of it to us.

                  <p>Now if we were to Judg of Things by the preſent Aſpect of Things, and of what is in Proſpect; we may have Reaſon to hope, That the Change of the World is near; and I ſhould Rejoice to be ſo happily Miſtaken; that it is indeed nearer, than, according to the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> I can conclude it; There is every where ſuch <hi>Labouring</hi> in the <hi>very Fire,</hi> and <hi>Wearying</hi> our <hi>ſelves for very Vanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, to conclude the whole Argument from the ſure Word of Prophecy, I would in brief preſent the whole Table of Time.</p>
                  <p>The whole ground Plot of Prophecy is the State of Things from the <hi>Firſt Creation,</hi> and <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> under the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> to the <hi>New Creation</hi> and <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of the <hi>Second Adam;</hi> Firſt Deſign'd, but <hi>Remaining</hi> to be Accompliſhed; even from the <hi>Foundation of the World;</hi> even when God on the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> Reſted from the Works, which <hi>He had made,</hi> according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 5, 7. It began to Remain to be Accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> Comprehends the Higheſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Temple State,</hi> or a State of Enjoyment of God; and alſo a <hi>Dominion, Lordſhip, Throne</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> and of <hi>his Seed</hi> over the Creation of God; <hi>All things being put under the Feet of him, and of his Seed,</hi> in the <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> which remains to the <hi>People of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God the <hi>Lord of Time, ,</hi> hath made, and given in his word an exact <hi>Line of Time,</hi> from <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> to <hi>Sabbatiſm;</hi> of near, or to the <hi>Evening,</hi> or between the two Evenings of the <hi>Sixth</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135384:89"/> 
                     <hi>Laſt Milenary,</hi> and allotted a Juſt <hi>Cubical Thouſand years,</hi> the perfection of Time to that <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Line</hi> is at this Day to be Found in Scripture, made up of <hi>Hiſtorical Time;</hi> reaching as far, as it was neceſſary to Reach, to make up ſuch a ſpace of Time; Till by Fair Commiſſures <hi>Prophetic Time</hi> came in, and joyn'd it, and made up the Reſt even 5759 years, to the great <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the two great <hi>Types of this Temple,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> at <hi>Solomons</hi> Death, This <hi>Line of Time</hi> is given plainly and Hiſtorically; Emboſs'd only with ſome Ornamental Reſemblances of that Kingdom and Temple-State: All which I have made out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very Letter of Scripture, and Fortified our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Copy,</hi> as truly the Word of God, by great Evidence (as I hope) of Argument from Scripture, and Scripture-Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And thoſe ſeveral <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Lines to <hi>Solomons</hi> Death make 3029 years; Theſe I do not particularize, becauſe they do not ſo properly fall under the <hi>ſure word of Prophecy,</hi> but the <hi>ſure word</hi> of <hi>Scripture-Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thence, even at <hi>Solomons</hi> Death, begins <hi>Prophetical Time,</hi> however <hi>Hiſtorically Supported</hi> in many great Branches of it; yet the <hi>Miniſtration,</hi> and <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of it is All <hi>Prophetical,</hi> and <hi>Myſtical:</hi> All and Each of theſe are of great Conſiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to him, whoever he be, that would underſtand Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>This general Plat-form being now laid according to, and in my <hi>Line of Time,</hi> I here preſent it in brief to View together.</p>

                  <p> I am now come to the laſt Head of this Diſcourſe I propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Some Brief Reflections, by way of Inference upon the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. This ſhews the great <hi>Price</hi> God hath put into our Hands, in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, of giving mighty Evidence to the Truth of the Scriptures; if the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> that hath come upon our Profeſſion, had not Robbed us of the Hearts, to make uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>For God hath given us a <hi>Sure werd of Prophecy,</hi> that cannot Fail, nor deceive us in any of the great Futurities, the things to Come, It hath Foretold; They ſhall certainly be <hi>Fulfill'd,</hi> each in their Seaſon; For Infinite Wiſdom, hath diſigned, and contrived them, that cannot upon any Emergent Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Change its Counſel; For it calls the End at the very beginning; Infinite Veracity or Truth hath Declared them, which cannot deceive, it is a ſure word; and Allmighty Power will bring them to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Now Prophecy, or <hi>Declaring things to Come</hi> is by God inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as the greateſt Aſſurance of the Divine Being; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us,</hi> ſays God, <hi>Things to Come, that we may know, you are Gods:</hi> Yea, do good, or evill; <hi>viz.</hi> When you have Foretold them; Let the Things Foretold come to paſs by your power: Now ſeeing our Scriptures are full of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> on which theſe Evidences muſt be Founded; There wants nothing but Interpretation; Adjuſting what is paſt, to its Juſt Times of Coming to paſs, according to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>History;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laying aſſured Grounds of <hi>Interpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ting Prophecy</hi> concerning what is to come: Oh, why do we not then concerning <hi>Things to Come,</hi> which Chriſt hath Promiſed, the Spirit ſhall lead us into and ſhew us; engage our ſelves in <hi>Interpretation?</hi> Seeing the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath aſſur'd, <hi>No Prophecy is of Private Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> or <hi>Reſerv'd;</hi> even as in things paſt, Relating to Chriſt, which we ſo vehemently Argue upon againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and with ſo great Reaſon, why not in things to come concerning his Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. We have hence Authority to Joyn Interpretation of Prophecy, and the Expectation of the Return of Miracles together, that when in <hi>Daniel,</hi> c. 12. 6. It is Enquired, <hi>How long ſhall it be to the End, or to the</hi> Perfecting <hi>of</hi> Wonders? Thoſe great Numbers of Time leading to the Bleſſed Time of the 1335 Days, that ſhall make every one Bleſſed, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:135384:94"/> Comes to them are Given; Certainly therefore Wonders ſhall be, or Miracles Return, when the Time of <hi>Finiſhing is.</hi> And thoſe numbers muſt Lead to that Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 3. How Earneſt, and Diligent ſhould we be to be <hi>Found of him in Peace,</hi> without Spot, and Blameleſs; not in a ſtate of War, when that Prince Comes, with his <hi>Name written on his Veſture,</hi> and <hi>on his Thigh, King of Kings, Lord of Lords;</hi> who in <hi>Righteouſneſs Judges,</hi> and <hi>makes VVar,</hi> and <hi>ſlays with the Sword,</hi> that <hi>proceeds out of his mouth:</hi> Oh, Let us therefore be <hi>Diligent,</hi> we may be <hi>found of him in Peace,</hi> and not in the Army of <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon,</hi> in that Battel <hi>with God Almighty;</hi> this is the coming to the 1335 Days, A Bleſſedneſs is pronounced upon in <hi>Daniel;</hi> A <hi>Coming</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the <hi>Armies of Heaven,</hi> in <hi>white Linen,</hi> on <hi>white Horſes,</hi> as his <hi>Called, Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Choſen; with him;</hi> on his ſide. How looking, and conſiderate ſhould we be upon this Concernment! That we be found truly Fix'd in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that neither in Regard of the fowl <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Errors, nor the inward Impurities of Heart, and Life, we are as <hi>wanding,</hi> and <hi>Falling Stars,</hi> for whom is <hi>reſerv'd the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs for ever;</hi> but may ſhine, as the <hi>Stars,</hi> and as the <hi>Firmament,</hi> Fix'd in that <hi>Firmament of Chriſtianity;</hi> by the light of which Holy Men are now <hi>wiſe to win Souls,</hi> and to <hi>turn many to Righteouſneſs;</hi> from which Antichriſt by <hi>Tranſgreſſion Fell, as a Star from Heaven upon Earth, and went down to Open that bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit,</hi> and fill'd the World with <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Smoke;</hi> and ſhall be caſt into his own place at that day, the <hi>Lake</hi> that Burns <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe Things ſeem hard to be underſtood, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>grow in Grace,</hi> and in the <hi>Knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. To him be Glory for Ever.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, I find, This <hi>Prediction</hi> Formed in the very Phraſe and Words, which are ſo Applicable to the ſacred Style; that conſidering both the Subſtance and the Happineſs of the very Expreſſion in ſeveral Inſtances, I cannot deny my ſelf the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and others the Benefit (as I hope and deſire) of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome Remarks upon ſuch an Effort of Providence; in giving to, whoever it was, a Prediction ſo agreeable to <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> a <hi>Prediction,</hi> in undeniable Fact, many years before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time, ſo conſonous to what, upon ſtrongeſt Arguments from the Word of God, with the Conſent of Undeniable, Univerſal <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> I have offered to General Knowledge, and Obſervation; To Excite to the Pondering of which Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proof, I have ſome Expectation; ſuch a Concurrent, ſhort <hi>Prediction</hi> (becauſe we are naturally Inclin'd to have ſome kind of Quicker Thoughts for ſuch) may not be unuſeful.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Prediction</hi> is affirm'd by Dr. <hi>Mayer,</hi> to have been found in the Study of <hi>Justus Lipſius,</hi> a Name ſo known to the World, for All Learning, and Sagacity of Enquiry into All Things; and of the <hi>Roman,</hi> (as they will have it call'd) <hi>Catholic Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, I can give no greater Proof, It was found there, than that Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> hath left it ſo Affirm'd; but if it was ſo; It Argues, There was ſome Obſervation Defer'd to it by him; that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135384:96"/> year 1475. the year before he died at <hi>Rome;</hi> And the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> I now Recommend, may ſeem to be a meer Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; and ſo to be the Diverſion of a Fanciful, Poetical, and Adventrous Pen, wantonizing upon a Former <hi>Prediction,</hi> and Running Counter to it; and that therefore there is no Regard to be had to it. But I ſhall argue the contrary, and that upon Due Compare of the one with the other, That in Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> will be much advanced in Repute.</p>
               <p>I do grant, That it was written by one, that had laid the Prediction of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> before him: Nay, I make no doubt, he writ it after the year 1588. when the Remarkable Events of that Famous Year had given Reputation to the <hi>Prediction</hi> upon it: Whoever therefore writ the Prediction before us, Coaſted, and Glanced along upon that of <hi>Regio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus,</hi> grown into Eſteem by Things Anſwering it; and grafts a far greater Prediction upon ſo much, as would ſerve his main purpoſe, and Leaves the Reſt. And this he did to give it ſome Remarkableneſs, by appearing in ſome of the Garb of what had obtain'd a Degree of Honor by the Effect Following it: But it indeed far exceeds its Copy; and ſince I know, it is ſo Truly according to the <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy,</hi> I am aſſur'd, whoever writ it, writ it either from a Judgment enlightned by deep Enquiry into <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> or by ſome Divine Impulſe, and far above the Copy.</p>
               <p>And as Reaſons of my Aſſurance herein, I make theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the other <hi>Prediction,</hi> there is nothing, but what falls within an ordinary Human imagination, ſuppoſing the world in an Hurly Burly, and Confuſion; but ſuch a <hi>Series</hi> of Events known only to Scripture, and its <hi>Prophecy,</hi> not to be Read in the Stars, nor in the Book of Nature, but the Book of God only, ſhews a much higher Original, than Human Imagination, taking Copy from one much lower than it ſelf; but either a mind Divinely Taught by Scripture Prophecy, or at leaſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially Impell'd, as <hi>Caiaphas's</hi> was, <hi>John</hi> 11. 51. and not <hi>ſpeaking of it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas in the other <hi>Prediction,</hi> The Events, though ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to be great, yet are but General, and Confuſed, and no one Expreſs; In this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> all is very great, each Event is of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135384:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> the greateſt, that can be Thought of with in the ſtate of the whole preſent World; each is Diſtinct, Firmly declared, Like one that knew he ſpake on great ground; this Poetry and Fancy do not uſe to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas a mere Fancy, or Humor of Foretelling would have choſen ſome nearer Time than above a <hi>Century</hi> beyond that 1588, to raiſe a quicker Expectation; and thereby a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Amuſe; this <hi>Prediction,</hi> carries ſteddily to 1698, ſo far off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Naked Fancy, or Incertainly guided Arrogancy of Fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elling, if it had born ſo Aloft, and at a Diſtance from the Time of the Former <hi>Prediction,</hi> would have hardly miſs'd of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of 1688, Anſwering 1588. For we ſee common Expectation hath of it ſelf run upon that year, and has not been greatly miſtaken, in Regard of the <hi>Revolution</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein <hi>All the European World</hi> hath been ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd alſo; to carry therefore the <hi>Prediction</hi> as from one 88, and not to ſtop, and quarry (as one may ſay) upon the next 88. but to fall Perpendicularly upon 98. is a higher flight, than of a Fancy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The words choſen out, by whoever, was the <hi>Predictor,</hi> ſo ſuſceptible of, ſo ready to Fall into, and to Cope with the words, and Images of <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> are a very great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Aſſurance; He either from Great Acquaintance with <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> and Aſſiſtance from it in that mediate way, or ſome more immediate Inſpirings of that <hi>Holy Spirit of Prophecy;</hi> or at leaſt from a <hi>Providential Impulſe,</hi> or Motion of Mind was Enabled to uſe words, which the <hi>Holy Spirit Teacheth, comparing Spiritual Things with Spiritual.</hi>
